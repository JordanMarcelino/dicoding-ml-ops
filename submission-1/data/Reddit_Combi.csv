"Envy to other is swallowing me Im from developingcountry, Indonesia , and for now i temporary work overseas for 3 years contract, it's a hard labor job, and stressful. Next year my contract is finish. But, during my stay here, because of job, and my social life, my depression got worse, and i envy this developed country. Why this country is so good. I can afford anything i want here. Why can't we just have equality in currency exchange? I I need to work 15-20 years in big company in jakarta(our capital city) , just to get equal amount of saving money from what i got from 3 years working here. Yes, that's right, it's saving money, not spending money. And yes, im going to be a rich person in such young age If I think about it, this society is sick, the gap of un equality beetwen developing vs developed country, or the poor vs the rich is too big right now. Sorry if i look like an evil person , but because of this,I almost wish for war to happen, or this world to end, and got reseted. So everyone can have another chance to gain equality, the poor can finally have a chance to have a better life. Because if this world order stay this way, it will eventually collapse on itself.

"Nothin outta the ordinary. Paradise. Job stress. Life stress. (F bombs call me hand medium-light skin tone beyond this point) read on Um hello ....well many can relate im sure. After today I’m convinced I’m a misanthrope. Kinda ironic cause here i go again trying to get support from others. I’m on my way to being a “construction specialist” really I’m just an asskisser. I’m below everyone. No one respects me because they think I’m doing better than they are when really i respect everyone even though I know 100% they’re doing a lot better than me. One more loose screw right there. I mean fuck ME, man. I mean I’m not getting paid that much. I drive a company vehicle. I work hard. Very very hard. I’m being micromanaged. I’m in charge of a lot of people and projects but as far as work...I think we kinda get in the way of trades doing the actual work. I hate this business. Im sure I’m”ADD” but nobody cares. It’s still my fault I mess up. People are like crabs in a bucket. I just told the painter to fuck off. I told an old guy in the parking lot to fuck off. Recently Ive moved states. Been 8 months. I can’t or don’t get a new state license so I can actually move forward. I work too much. My car is in need of repair. I bought a motorcycle which I can’t ride legally. I’m living in a house that isn’t mine. I’m staying in a nice place with an awesome view by myself. House sitting and paying them a decent amount of rent while the owners are outta town...that’s about to end in a few weeks. Hard to keep up. Social life is super super lacking and dull of course. . First time moving away on my own. Sucks when Everyone is telling me what to do. And I do it. There’s a lot going on. Exact words to the painter who was complaining about my handy work (since it’s not my job/not my specialty which I blatantly spelled out to them....is ironic considering my soon to be former position) the exact words were “ quite frankly......I. Don’t. Give. a. FUCK. I’m this close to ...” and I just shook my head and he understood right away. Either I was having a mental breakdown, burnt out or that he needed to shut his trap before I shoved that paintbrush where the sun don’t shine. As for the old man. I was driving with expired plates because I had to do some side work on the weekend and I couldn’t drive my work truck because it has a company logo. So I can’t even flip people off anymore! I explained this to the guy. Been working 60 hour weeks none stop. Happened to have work I couldn’t refuse right on the weekend so I had to risk going out again with this vehicle. I’ve been pissed off at retirees lately since I’ve done a lotta work for them in this nice area. I usually have respect but I get fed up with sucking up to people that act like toddlers. Once he took out his phone to take a pic of my license plate, I got out and asked if he was retired? He said ....yeah I am. And looked him in the eye and said “then fuck off! Go find something better to do.” He eventually left saying have a good day. But I’m just so fuckin DONE with people and myself and the world. I just don’t know how this is gonna go. It’s an ever narrowing tunnel. For ALL OF US. I mean To add to it, I lost/spent all my savings so far (not much but very much needed at this point 2 grand and then some) on fuckin online dating and scammers and complete incompetence/desperation on my part. So yeah. Don’t know what to do or where to go...options are “endless” but I keep thinking a giant meteor would simplify that quite nicely don’t you? Don’t expect anyone to actually read this all the way through or even give a shit. Or what I expect you to type. Hopefully someone relates or even chuckles like “yeah that’s me” I don’t care. I just gotta know someone else will read this and potentially understand than just let this sit and stew inside me. I’m just venting. So Say hello internet. I’m about to fucking lose it",1
Almost 49 and the chasm of emptiness has never been greater I’ve been diagnosed severe bi polar where you no longer even get the good manias They just manifest as agitation or rage. After 32 years of fighting this shit I know there can be only one end. I’ve tried everything except DMT or psychedelics but why would that help Unless you can live in that realm for a majority of the time. I’ve always known it would never get better because there is just no way to overcome that the ROI on life is an investment no one would ever make it given the choice.,1

"Is it possible to recover from such a traumatic childhood? I am only 15, and yet I feel my life is already over. I just have a pit and emptiness in my stomach that I don’t see going away long-term. 4 years ago, my mom killed herself, and I found the body. Safe to say, my childhood was a shit show of fear, emotional manipulation, feeling like a parent to my parent, despair, fighting etc. I live with my dad and sister now. My dad is a really nice guy, but has ZERO emotional intelligence. The other night, I was crying and screaming to him about how I wanted to kill myself and some other problems, and all he did was look at me with a blank expression and say he would call the police. He says he is worried about me, but I have never once felt emotionally conncected to him. I feel empty. My psych told me I have disorganised attachment style which Is apparently the worst. Coupled with the fact that I hate myself like poison and don’t think I deserve that to change, the future doesn’t seem very bright. On top of that, I think I got my mum’s good old depression gene. It seems my life is on a trajectory that is all too familiar. I feel as though I and floating in space, all alone, unable to connect to anyone because of what I’ve gone through. I am far more emotionally intelligent than anyone in my social circle, so while I’m always helping them, I have no one to begin to help me. Interactions are fun, but always empty. Everything is empty. I have no rules or discipline at all. Never have. Don’t care enough about myself to create it for myself. That’s my rant. Any advice?",1
"I’m finding it hard to find a reason to get up in the mornings again. Isn’t it so horrible that, I don’t really want to die, but I also just like don’t really want to do anything at all? Like I kind of wish I could just sleep. Or maybe just like lay in bed all day. I don’t want to be lazy but at the same time I don’t want to do anything. I feel like I don’t deserve to live and Im just wasting space. Like there’s people that actually were going to be someone and do something with their life, who have just died. and i’m here wasting my life and wasting the space. I wish i could give my life to someone more meaningful.",1
"I convinced myself I was going to commit suicide sometime in the next 2 weeks. Then I walked to the kitchen and saw my beautiful, loving family. Now I cant stop crying I want to die so badly, but I cant do this to them. They greeted me with smiles and joy. My mother asking if I ate anything and if I wanted breakfast. My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way.",1
all i do is work and i can never catch a break literally i always have assignments to do with no time to do them and i never have a day to just do nothing and im so sick of it. like im so behind in classes and then i’ll find out i have a project due tmrw and my sleep schedule is also so fucked rn so i wake up at like 5pm and i never have any time to do any of my work. and when i do i just end up failing exams or quizzes. i just hate this quarantine and i hate online classes and i just want it all to b over so i can have my life back.,1
"Ive decided to get admitted to a hospital instead of just killing myself Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it. Thank you for reading and i sincerely hope that everyone in this subreddit overcomes their depression, no matter how impossible or pointless it may seem. Good luck to everyone",1
"I’m doing well, but not feeling well. A reflection. I’ve been under a lot of stress lately. I’m in my 40s, in a middle managemnet position and am finishing up my first semester of graduate business school. I’m happily married and my husband loves me. All my needs are met financially. I’m doing well in all of these areas of life, exceeding even. But I’m also struggling deeply. I can’t sleep. I feel sick sometimes. I’m exhausted. I can’t wind down. My social life is nonexistent. I love my job. I love school. I get a high from both. But the relentless demands are killing me. It literally hurts when i try to relax. It makes me want to go be an Amish or something.

"Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.] The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. ",1
"I'm not lazy at school, I just need some understanding is all. I have to go back to physical school tomorrow and I dread it. School is one of the reasons I wanted to die. I'm particularly good at maths but my memory is so awful I can't remember anything at all and that's how I score so less in exams. I'm traumatized of ever getting anything average because of the times I've been beaten by my parents or punished or have the one thing taken from that motivates me to even get up. I don't even have access to means of killing myself. I can't jump off a building because I live in a short building. Tried choking myself but I bailed out at the last second. No pills to OD on and I'm too weak mentally to slit my wrists. I'm so socially awkward, I constantly disappoint those around me and I feel terrible. It hurts. I wish I could just have a job that didn't require me to be smart. I'm not. It doesn't help that I also have ADHD and the shortest attention span. I cannot concentrate on anything. So tomorrow I go back to school and none of my notes and assignments are done and I barely know anything. Can't wait to get a complaint from my teachers and get the shit beaten out of me again. Before you say to call the cops or anything on my parents....I can't...I love them too much. I'm too mentally weak to do anything to hurt anyone. Idk why I am like this. If you read this, I'm sorry.

"Screen Time Negatives I feel like these screens are more harmful than we realize. As we’ve turned to them during this global lockdown for a way to connect to people safely, I feel another trend has arisen and that’s the negative effects that these screens have on our interactions. Demand People expect you to be available at the drop of a hat, because they know you’re currently glued to your phone. Hyperbole aside, I make sure my phone migrates from room to room with me. For work, for emergencies, it doesn’t stray from my side. That doesn’t mean I owe anyone an immediate answer. Distance You can type things you wouldn’t dare say out loud. (Like what I just typed about not owing anyone an immediate response.) Because you can’t see the persons face, you are less in tune with their reaction and therefore less concerned about the effect your words will have. Curating Interactions Because it’s not instant, you have time to craft your response. That means the exchange of texts or emails when it resembles a conversation is a highly curated interaction in which each participant can choose how long they take to perfect their response. While this should promote clarity in that you can take your time to gather information and respond, it actually means people have time to manipulate answers. Intentional “On Read” There can be an effect to silence. Sometimes silence speaks. Think about a pregnant pause in natural conversation that lets you know someone is thinking... When we can use the screens between us to ignore someone, to be silent, sometimes that’s louder than outright hostility. Concluding my list as I write this at 00 38, I was up having these thoughts and letting them run their course hoping they would serve the same purpose as counting sheep. No luck. The contemplation woke me up and for fear of losing my train of thought, I immediately reached for my phone. Now I’ve extended this late night indefinitely as I labor over this post and begin yet another highly curated interaction between strangers using screens. Who’s with me? nerd_face ",0

She knew that she was the only person I trusted and she knows everything about me, and yet she hasn't minded seeing me hurt. I don't know if I can trust someone again.

Looking back at the last 10 years all I can think is, why couldn't I just fucking chillllll I ran full speed into every bad decision, made every wrong choice.

No education, betrayed family, I'm dependent on the government and kindness of a coworker to support my 2 little boys and myself, my job doesn't pay the rent to say the least, but I've got not qualifications, no ged or hs diploma.

"Trying medication again/A needed ramble Hi I’m new here. I’ve battled with depression for maybe 15 years? Or more I don’t even know. The last year has been so much worse for me and it has nothing to do with Covid. I’m honestly sick of hearing about covid. My grandmother died a year ago and I feel like that’s when things made a turn for the worse. Her death was horrible. It wasn’t sudden but it wasn’t expected. Her health took a turn for the worse out of nowhere and she slowly died and I had to watch everyday for two months. It was traumatizing. My anxiety had become so unbearable I reached out to my asshole doctor for medication and got prescribed Prozac which I had used before and it helped. This time it helped but then I found it started making me incredibly angry and worse. So I went off and tried to just deal with it. Because there are good days where I do feel fine. But then it started happening again so I reached out to a psychotherapist. She helped me to acknowledge how shitty of a childhood I had so now more trauma has been brought up. I feel so overwhelmed with things in my life as well. Like working night shifts(which I should be getting off soon hopefully), a renovation to our only bathroom that started in April and still isn’t done.. body image issues like crazy. I have 1 friend but I try not to vent to her because I hate being so negative all the time. Friends are so hard to make for me. Anyway I have a lot going on. I made the call to my doctor again to try a different medication and cried to his receptionist. While my husband just stood there and didn’t comfort at all. He actually just left the room as I cried in a ball. Anyway I’ll wrap this up as I should probably go to sleep in prep for work. Ugh.",1
Just speaking my mind. Don't mind me. I am scared. I am falling into darkness. I am feeling unwell. I am happy in my life. But That's how people see me. But I am losing it. I laugh while I sleep. I cry when I wake. I crave death. There are so many methods. It all causes pain. But I can't feel them. I can't process emotions. What is pain? Sounds like something I know. I shall fall into the ocean. I will see darkness. I will panic. I will fight for my life. But eventually I shall get what I asked for. I will be free.,1

Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable. All of these things were completely unexpected.

"Am I Not in Control? Does anybody else get this feeling from stress like you're not in control of your own body in any way? Like you can't think critically, or sometimes at all. Your motions are like jelly, and even when you get control, you're super uncoordinated or a clumsy. In social situations, you feel more like a passenger for your own body who has no idea what to say or do but still has the capacity to be angry at yourself for not saying anything or doing something. It's like this self-awareness that stops short of allowing me to do anything. I have a lot of stressors in my life, and I can't help but think they've burnt me out so much so that I've become subject to these things. I've been told before to prioritize or to take on less things as a solution, but to me that's synonymous with settling on being capable of less than I thought I'm capable of. How do people function with high stress? How do you groom yourself to do that? I've lived like this for so many years and thought it would just come with experience, but now it just feel harder than its ever been",1

"Could this all be stress from an exam? Sorry for long post. 25M. The last month I have no clue what’s going on. It started with an internal hemorrhoid that seems to have gone now, but right after my bowel habits changed for the first time in my life. I’m not sure if I was constipated because I was still going in some fashion and it was soft. I also started to get back aches, especially in the lower back. My stomach was really bloated and my back was killing me as I was taking a cpa exam, I’ve wanted to go to the hospital several times but my parents talked me out of it. I took a laxative after my exam and that relieved the back pain and trouble, but since I’ve had an on and off burning sensation in my stomach, lower abdomen, and even thighs at time. The thighs have gone but it almost feels like there is a tight rubber band around my waist at times with an uncomfortable burning feeling. I do have anxiety troubles but I’m in CBT and things have been awesome. My GP said IBS but blew it off, and another GI guy just said Colonoscopy instantly. I saw one more person this week and he gave me some antispasmodics to try first before any colonoscopy. What’s weird is since I talked to him yesterday, the last day and a half, my symptoms have been just about nonexistent. Can’t be a coincidence can it? I haven’t even tried the medication yet and there’s been some burning tonight but not much, and I’m not even sure this is a Gastro issue. I’m trying to pass my last exam and just failed by one point and I take it again next week…could the pressure and stress of this exam be doing this to me?",1

"One of the worst side effects of my depression is the brain fog, but I never see anyone talk about it. I don't know if this is the correct term to use for what I am referring to, but I feel like I can't be living the same way most human do. The best way I can describe it is that I'm only using 1% of my brain lol. I used to be a smart and intuitive girl, but for the past couple of years it's like I have no idea what's going on around me, I can't remember anything, I feel so fucking dumb all the time, and everything feels blurry and confusing. I think I've been holding in too much and my body and brain are shutting down. That's my best guess. Edit Wow! Just wanted to say another thank you to everyone sharing their experiences here, I feel way less alone, and ashamed. I can relate to so, so many of you. red_heart ",1
"The thought of the minuscule chance of coming across my boyfriend on Bumble two years ago makes me incredibly grateful to have him today. I came across my boyfriend in 2019 on bumble. Not sure what my profile looked like or his or what it said but I’m happy we matched. We went on a date and we were very similar however we were both busy and never set up a second date. Fast forward a year later, he requested me randomly on Instagram. Which we had never shared with each other. I messaged him and the next week we were on a date. It lasted like 8 hours and we just talked and talked and talked. It was amazing. Since then, we’ve been together, moved in, and are almost at a year! We are like the same person, and I could not be more grateful for him. It may sound silly but I think of the very tiny chance of meeting him on the app, or the tiny chance of coming across each other again and it makes me so much more grateful for him. Last year before we met again he had a plan to move back East after college. This year, he stayed in my state with me. Just feeling super blessed and I know sometimes dating apps aren’t great, but sometimes you come across some great people.",0

"Anyone else have semi-suicidal thoughts on a regular basis? I’m not saying gun to my head thoughts. I mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says “just turn into the opposite lane. It’ll look like an accident” but then I just shake it off. Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. ",1
"For the first time in 4 years, I feel hopeful for what the future holds for me. I've never really been hopeful for anything. And if I have been, it's never lasted for more than an hour. My expectations have always been at rock bottom to protect myself from disappointment. This has worked well for me, with minimal hurt from hoping too much. But. I don't need to do that anymore. I don't necessarily know why, but since June, I've been looking forward to waking up every morning. Actually, I know why. It's because the belief that I had to die to feel at peace has been proven wrong. Completely wrong. It's so reassuring to know it is possible to be happy and alive at the same time. For the past few years, I've been wallowing in my depression. I feared death but at the same time craved it. So, as foolish as I was. I tried. Failed. And regretted backing out for about 8 months. Mainly because I was now on people's watchlist. I had a fear of pills for a while. Just the thought of them made my stomach twist and turn. I would constantly lay in bed, stay up late to wake up minutes before the bus. I was convinced that there was nothing left for me. So I acted impulsively. If I was gonna go. I was going to go out with a bang. I fractured my hand. Had a scrap with my Bastard of a Parent. Attempted. Planned another. But at the same time, I desperately hung on. I didn't really want to die. No one really does. A close friend of mine dragged me out. I will always admire and appreciate her for having the patience to deal with me. She let me stay. And I've realized, her family is the polar opposite of mine. Calm and quiet majority of the times. Full of fun. Laughter. They don't raise hands or lace poison in their words. I didn't know that this was possible. For me to be happy for more than an hour. For me to be a part of a household where my contribution is appreciated and needed. Where my mental illness is not a myth. Where my feelings don't have to be locked away. I feel so validated and unconditionally loved. I want to start getting professional help. To better myself. I feel like with this. I can keep pushing forward. That I will keep standing up after falling down. No matter how many times that will be. I don't know why, but I feel happy to be here.",1

"My family is holding me back and making my life hell and its ruining my job and health. A bit of background My sister struggles with mental illness to the extreme, we're talking cops at our door, constant trips to the hospital, alternate schooling and the whole lot. She needs 24/7 supervision and we have to have everything locked away out of her reach at all times. I currently live with both my mom and my sister and needless to say its very overwhelming dealing with her. Me and my mom have a hard time keeping it together and my mom will often turn on me due to stress, and since I have no outlet it makes going to work near impossible because I just sit and get angry about whats going on at home. Now suddenly our landlord turned around and sold the house, weve lived there for over 13+ years, been good tenants and always paid rent on time, he gave us no written notice and has made our life a living hell. Its all super illegal but thats a completely different story. We have 2 months to leave, our original plan was to get a 3bdrm and split it but due to high housing prices (we live in a big city) and landlords are ridiculous here, super scummy, they try to charge for many illegal things even asking hundreds of dollars just to fill out and submit an application. Even then its not a guarantee and half the places are bug infested and in the centre of crackhead central. Ive suggested to her that she finds a cheap 2 bedroom in the city for the time being with my sister. She needs to stay in the city or my sister loses all her support workers, schooling and the lot, its a 2 year waiting list minimum to get back in a program even if we provide transportation because the city will no longer cover it. I drive and work fulltime I can go where ever I want. My mother however doesnt drive and is currently laid off due to covid. I dont want to deal with them anymore, the constant violent out bursts, the screaming and crying, everyone at my work thinks im crazy because im always crying or throwing up from stress. I had to go on stress leave before this because the physical effects from stress was making it impossible and dangerous to work. The dizzyness and vomiting and the whole lot. Now when I suggested going our seperate ways to my mom I offered to help her in any way she would need including money and transportation to whatever extent I could spare, it ended with her screaming and crying that I was abandoning her. This makes me feel terrible but also makes me lean towards leaving even more. What route do I take? I know moneys already very tight for her and I love her but living like this day to day is literally killing me and I want to grow as a person and live my life. Tldr; my family struggles with mental health and I have the option to leave for my own sanity but it means abandoning them in their time of need.",1

"Today I got invited to a wedding and was told I was the reason they met! I’ve been on a bit of a downer recently but this has made me so happy! I spend a month every year in South Korea. Back in 2019, I planned a trip to the coast for just myself but decided to invite a friend of mine. She asked me if she could make it a big trip and bring 15 people I’d never met before. I said yes because I love meeting new people and I love the international community in SK. I booked 2 earlier extra days just for myself so I was there Thursday- Monday and she booked a 15 person house in the same airbnb right by my room for Sat-Monday. So I went and enjoyed two blissful days sat on the balcony and walking around the coast. On the saturday they all arrived, 2 different groups of friends my friend had got together to come down. We all had a wonderful time meeting each other, having bbqs, playing games, watching the sunset on the ocean etc Well today, I got a message on FB from a couple I met there. She was asking me to join their wedding via zoom and told me that they actually met on that trip. They wanted me, someone they’d only met for 2 days, to be at their wedding, because I was the one who had helped them meet! I am just so so so thrilled!!! I thought they already were together on that trip, I had no idea! I’m just super happy and can’t wait to witness their happy day.",0
I have been self harm-free since February and I’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy. I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help. Edit Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing. Been getting that suggestion from the people in my life and it’s something physical with a healthier outlet. It’s still not easy but I now know that I’m not alone. Thank you Reddit.,1

"I want to get help Hello my name is Pryscilla, I’m 20. I should be very happy. Just a quick run-down I go to college, I work, I have an amazing boyfriend, and I have friends. Lately keeping up with all this has gotten harder. Throughout my life it has been a series of crazy events and most of my life has been me going through depression even in my childhood years. I didn’t grow up in a healthy environment, I lost the person who helped raise me and who I saw everyday, am sleeping in his room, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship my high school to college years and now I should be happy. I was content before but I don’t know what happened. I talk to my boyfriend about it and I smoke weed all the time, I’ve grown addicted. I smoke to escape reality. I feel terrible. I feel like a terrible person and I get mood swings all the time. My boyfriend absolutely loves me and he urges me to get therapy and I want to. Especially because I want this relationship to work but most of all I just want to be happy for once. I am constantly negative and overthinking and I cry a lot, some days I feel like a different person. I want to seek therapy but I don’t have money, I’m broke. I’m not asking for anything but I don’t know where to go. I ask my mom to help me find therapy and she doesn’t take me seriously, even though years ago I had a suicide attempt and she dragged me to a therapist in which I denied help. But now I want it. What are the first steps to finding a good psychologist, how do I know what type to look for, how do I get a diagnosis, and does the fact that I have insurance help? Thank you.",1

It’s my 25th birthday today. Even though I don’t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms— birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that I truly am alone. Spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food. Even if friends were there to celebrate it with me I just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy.

"How to get out of the habit of stressing Hi everyone, I have come to realise that my mind and body is defaulted towards being stressed. From the minute I open my eyes, to the minute I close them I am constantly ""doing"" things and feeling like I am a few steps behind. So for me it seems like an ingrained habit that I sort of deault to constantly. Does anyone have any ideas on how to break the habit of stressfully doing things and balancing it with just being?

I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?' When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. I don't really know why I'm writing this here.

"Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better? I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out. Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health. I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite. Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING.

What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore.

Shure, it got more intense the last six months before hitting the wall, but in reality, it started ten years earlier when I started studied to get a master's degree in engineering. In short. I kept myself busy ALL the time. I didn't particularly feel that stressed out, I know the 'bad' kind of stress which just cause a tremendous amount of anxiety, and that wasn't very present.

This time the reason is also a sad one but not related too someone passing away.

But what if in a couple years, when I'm finally ready to enjoy my life, I get diagnosed with cancer or some other disease because of the shit I went through?

"I don't really want to die, but I don't want to be alive. Title kinda says it all really. I don't want to be alive, I'm just too tired. But I don't neccesarily want to die. It's hard to explain",1
"I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young. Just like the title says I am 58 M. I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to...... Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er. The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through. BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State. Have a good day. ",1
"im exhausted boutta rant here, but i am so exhausted. i have been nonstop stressed for the past six months and i can't tell what is health issues anymore and what is stress taking a toll on me. my shoulders feel so heavy and get tense to a point where i have a difficult time breathing for a few seconds, i am super tired, my sleeping abilities have all but rotted and falling asleep is hell, staying asleep is also hell. ive become such a grinch it's so upsetting. i am trying my best to be positive and feel good, but then health things happen and i just ",1
"i dont know how to deal with it over the past few days ive done nothing but stress about school, and its gotten to me, and now everytime i wake up at night i wanna die, and i stress way too much and i just dont wanna stress like this anymore. i want it to end.",1
"Worst night yet (long rant) I'm 15 right now, school is becoming so hard, I've got to the point where I'm so stressed that I just spend all my time thinking about my work instead of actually doing it. For the next 3 weeks, I've got a big important test each day. They're not even exams, just big tests. I told myself that I would start studying yesterday i came home, opened my agenda and started crying, it was big, ungly, loud sobs. I'm so stressed, I basically had a mental breakdown over school, and this isnt even the hardest year. One of the only ways I deal w stress is cutting myself, so that occupied me for a while. People always say put ur mental health before school work, but for me, a lazy perfectionist, that makes my mental health worse. I'm so tired because by the time I've finished crying about how much work I have, I'm completely drained and I fall asleep. I then wake up when my parents come home so 8PM, have dinner and then start my school work. I'm usually still up at 1-2 AM. Then I wake up at 7 and start again. AND MY TEACHERS THEN GIVE US MORE FUCKING WORK CUZ U KNOW, 1 MENTAL BREAKDOWN A WEEK ISNT ENOUGH!!!! I cant fucking deal w this anymore but if I give up on school then I'll be even more stressed if such a thing is possible",1
"I don't even know why I'm depressed I've been in an endless cycle of momentary happiness and a deep hard drop for so long now. I don't even know why I'm depressed anymore. Most of the things in my life that have kept me down I feel like I've made peace with. I miss feeling happy, like genuine happiness, not where I suppress my sadness and force myself to be happy and put on a brave fave in front of everyone. I had a girlfriend and whenever I tried to talk to her she told me it wasn't her problem and that she couldn't help me (not in so many words but yeah). Now she's gone and I'm doing better cause I have some friends to talk to but that hasn't helped either. I find myself falling again, losing motivation again, feeling like ending it all again. I've contemplated suicide multiple times but I haven't taken the leap just yet. I don't know how much longer I can take this. It seems like I'm only ever happy when I do drugs but I don't have the money for that and I already recovered from an addiction once and I can't fall into one again. Idk why I'm typing this but last time I posted on a subreddit, typing out my feelings really helped. I feel like me not knowing why I'm depressed makes me more depressed and it just keeps getting worse.",1
"Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up EDIT Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3 I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth. My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves. It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together. School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time. I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat. Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",1
Dealing With A Stressful Situation When All Alone nan,1
"Money, Games, Nonsense So I stress about the worst stuff (Things I shouldn't be stressed about) I have recently spent $300 on a roleplaying game for deluxe cars and I'm now starting to regret it realising that I might not stay on that server for less than a year so I'm thinking to myself what was the point I just put $300 in the trash because since they are my only friends and they leave then I would be alone and wouldn't want to stay in that server and then I wouldn't be able to savor the cars that I spent $300 on. I'm also stressing about the same server, I only have 3 friends in that server some might leave in like a month or two some might leave in a year, so I want to spend as much time with them as I can same thing for the $300 I spent. I had to decide to get a job (In game) and wanted to be a police officer which I thought was really cool but in a previous situation the work of a police man in that server was really stressful which I realised from one annoying guy so I wanted to quit and be a prison guard which isn't that much of a fun job but I would be with my four friends who work together there. My dad (IRL) told me that I shouldn't quit something because of one annoying person since there are a lot of people who are going to be annoying in my life. I stress about multiple other things but those are not what are stressing me that much now anymore. I love this server and I want to continue playing on it. I have vowed not to use that much money a game ever again, which is already a start but what has been done is done and I've decided to work with my friends even if the job isn't that cool (cause I want to spend time with them), but I still can't stop stressing about all of it. Does anyone have any ways to not stress about things like this overall?",1
"Labeled as mature for being apathetic At a young age I was called mature by those older than me, due to my lack of showing emotions.

"I am so excited to move to my new hometown This day is finally in sight and I’ve been waiting for years and it’s finally here! I am finally leaving the ghetto shithole where I’ve suffered and been depressed and wanted to die for 18 long hard years and moving to a resort town of 1500 people near a beautiful beach. My new hometown is away from all the filthy smog in the city, and overall the attitude of the people is miles ahead of my old place. No longer will I be blankly stared at by losers and degenerates. Nowadays I will be waved at and have pleasant conversation with my refined gentlemanly and ladylike neighbours. Now I can safely go for walks to a quiet park that’s not filled with disgusting people and not have to worry about some asshole’s untrained pit-bull or Rottweiler going nuts and attacking me. I also can walk in peace knowing that there aren’t any dipshits driving full speed while having horrible music on full blast. I can hear the birds singing, there’s ample forest that I can likely go hunting in, and I think my romantic and sexual mating chances are very high since there’s lots of beautiful beach babes down a few blocks from my house p. I am so extremely hyped to move there, I’ve been depressed and felt unwelcome long enough. Now it is time to live the high life and embrace my true happy self that’s long waited to truly show. Special thanks to everybody who’s helped me at least survive through the doldrums, you all know who you are. This is straight up one of the best things to ever happen to me ever, period. I am thrilled beyond belief. ))",0
"Can't afford university University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby). This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account. Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system. I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date. Thanks to anyone reading this far.",1
"Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now. Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. {My thoughts on my father} {{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}} {my thoughts on my brother} {{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it. I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5 30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother. Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up. My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset. (A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan. So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}} This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. {my thoughts on my mother} {{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history (Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day. I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. ) And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}} {thoughts on my own disgusting self} It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me. I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",1
"Why do I have to do this? Most of the time I'm in a good mood, of course I have bad and good days, but sometimes there are those days when everything seems so pointless to me and the pressure just overwhelms me, where I wonder why? Why does everything have to be so shitty, why is everything I do wrong, why am I here, why can't everything be different and why must I put such a high pressure on me, why do I have to be perfect, why can't I just be let go, let me live and not treat me like shit, like an animal that has to be punished for its existence, for its very existence. Wiping out that existence just feels right sometimes.",1
"Should I tell my father about my chronic stomach pain due to stress? About 2 years ago, I started having terrible stomach pains all the time, which were usually worsened by any kind of stress that I faced throughout the day. Last year, my father became very worried about this, and decided to take me to the doctor to see what could be causing it. My bowel movements were regular, I avoided foods that I was allergic to, and the doctor could not find anything wrong. But I did not mention my stress to her at the time. After this visit, I took a blood test and an ultrasound, but I seemed to be in perfect health. Then, we saw a GI doctor, and I finally decided to ask if my stress levels were part of the cause of my stomach pain. After I explained the situation a little more, he told me that my issues were definitely stress related, and that I should visit a psychiatrist. He also advised me to start taking therapy. I actually used to take therapy for something other than stress. I had been regularly engaging in self harm, and fallen into the deep pits of depression about a year before my stomach pains had started. So when my father found out, he asked me to start taking therapy. It worked great, and I loved going, but I think we all know that therapy is pretty expensive. My father has a good, stable job, and is paid well enough, but my mother doesn't have a job and he has two children. We try not to spend too much money, but continuing to get therapy on his salary is just impossible. So I stopped taking therapy after we moved cities. My father started getting paid around $20,000 more per year after the move, and we started living in an area where rent is much more reasonable. A few months ago, my father told me that he wanted me to start taking therapy again if my stomach pain would not go away. But I knew that he would still have a difficult time affording it. I also knew that he was having a hard time sleeping at night because of the stress that I was causing him. I love my father a lot, and I don't want to trouble him any more than I already do. So I started lying to him and saying that my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I thought I would be able to keep up the lie, but the pain seems to only be getting worse. What should I do?",1
"How do I deal with this Hello I'm a 19 year old (f), english is not my first language so sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm suffering from burn-out symptoms and have a fear of failing (idk is this has a name), especially when it comes to school. I am currently only doing 2 subjects, maths and chemistry, so that next year I can go to university. Its been almost 2 years since I started having burn-out/stress symptoms. I cry alot, get stressed by tiny things. So when I make a mistake in my calculations in maths or something, it is possible for my to start crying and have a semi-panick attack. I am seeing a psychologist so I am getting some help. But at home it is different, I still live with my parents and lil sister. My mum tries to help by saying, ""oh its only two subjects no need to worry, dont be so stressed"" and other quotes like that, my dad does the same. But this is only making my fears and stress worse, it makes me feel like I am being silly for feeling like this and not good enough for these subjects. When I tried talking to my mum about it she told me that she cant help it if I am interpretatting it negatively and that I shouldnt think like that and she got a bit mad. I just said ""okey"" as I didnt know what to do and felt now worse than before. My stress has gotten so bad now that sometimes I have a semi-panick attack over minor things, like talking to strangers, when my parents tell me to do something, small changes in my schedule etc. Now we (me and my family) are going on vacation soon and I'm getting really stressed about it because my tests are really short after and when I try to tell my parents how stressed I am they just start again with the oh its only two subjects thing and get a little mad when I say I dont want to go with them. All this has brought some tension between me and my parents and I really dont know how to talk with them about this anymore. Everytime I start thinking about it I start crying and all that. Do any of you have some advise for me? Sorry for the long story, sorry if its written a bit hasty. I'm trying to do homework but keep having small panick attacks.",1

She has asked me to do things I’m not comfortable doing because of safety (like going into the office at times it’s not required or making calls while driving) and doesn’t respect us. She complains about how I wasn’t properly trained or something and then rarely answers my emails or questions but reminds us frequently she expects replies within 1-2 hours of her contacting us.

"I need help and I don't know how to get it. At this moment in time I am coping with something. I feel so broken and have been crying all day. The stresses in addition whatever underlying problem I might have is really kicking my ass. I sought help twice before and the doctor hurt me a lot more than he possibly knew. He was focused on my sexuality. He insinuated that being gay was abnormal (not directly) and that I was feeling bad due to uncertainty. But that was never my issue and just made the years of shame in regards to my sexuality influenced by people around me become a lot more extreme. I don't know if I'm qualified or at the State of needing hospitalization but feel nonfunctional. I feel embarrassed and immense amount of shame. I feel like I failed at life. I don't have a family doctor but use walk in clinics. Should I be asking for a therapist, psychologist or any other specific doctor?

"Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly. I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will. I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me. And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them. But, it helped so much. Honestly. Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care. To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life. I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone. She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen. She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice. Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

"I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please? I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma. Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine! About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it.

"My insights on my stress and how I handle it. I'm recovering of a burn out and I'm learning more about myself. **Measuring** I have noticed I've got 4 points where I can measure my stress - Physical - Mental - Emotional - My motivation and perseverance When I'm stressed - Physically I just get pains everywhere when my body is in stress. My muscles ache or problems with my bowel. - Mentally I have no concentration to do normal thinking, analysing or problem solving. Watching/reading/listen is just a no go. - Emotionally I cry often when an emotion pops up. I can't control my emotions, they take over. - My motivation/perseverance is minimal to not there at all, I can hardly take care of myself (eat, drink, hygiene) so doing things I want or need to do are just out of the question. When I'm in this fase I'm out. I just can sleep, I walk because I need to and I'm happy my parents provide me with food. **Making my own stress thermometer** I made a chart where I put the 4 measures next to each other and made 4 rows under it - RED burn out tired_face - ORANGE stressed confounded_face - YELLOW minor stressed disappointed_face - GREEN peaceful relieved_face In every cell I put indicators. For example when I'm in yellow I can still watch a new movie, but not in orange, but usually not fully just about an hour. In orange I loose motivation. This way I can track my daily stress level. **Origin of my stress** I know I have some beliefs and expectations that cause me to ignore my feelings of need for rest. It feels like the emotions of the beliefs and expectations are prioritised higher then my feeling of tiredness. Actually my whole wellbeing is prioritised less then my beliefs and expectations. **How I plan to recover** I'm resting right now, I'm lucky I get the time from my job to be sick and get paid leave. Daily I rest, walk, attend to my plants, clean up my house, I try to do at least 2 or 3 small tasks which I know are good for my wellbeing even though it can be hard. I'm mindful, I meditate and I'm very aware of my emotions. When they pop up I try to understand what belief or expectation is behind the emotions. When they pop up when I need to make a difficult choice I choose rationally for my wellbeing. Rest, rest and more rest (physical, mental and emotional). Even though it takes a lot of courage to overcome the emotions I get not listening to my beliefs and expectations. I'm not helping anybody when I can't even do things for myself! After making a choices like this I get proud of myself because I choose me partying_face **Motivation and perseverance** I have noticed that my motivation and perseverance grows when I'm more rested again grinning_face_with_big_eyes So, I started to do things that I love to do and give me satisfaction.",1
"I don't enjoy being... human Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better. I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree). I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job. And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff. In my country there is a cult of working your ass off. If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor. Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all. I just hate being human. Sorry for my English, blah blah, I hope you'll understand everything.",1

"Question This is relatively new to me. Over the past six month i have been very stressed. Though i have been experiencing something that is weird; i have been going to the toilet much more frequently, depending on the stress level. On some very stressful days i would have to urinate more than 12 times. Is that a stress related issue? Ive come to the conclusion that it is, since, ive done multiple tests and check ups to rule out any physical problems. Is anyone experiencing the same issue?",1
Money and Mother So today I’m stressing and having a painful headache. Today my whole family says I’m “codo” (Mexican street word of saying cheap) that it hurts for me to spend money on my mother. Which is half true it hurts but I at least give her something like right now I’ve been doing better on give her some money so she can buy herself something or when I bought her pans because she needed pans. But this week I failed for her birthday because i didn’t willingly offered to buy the cake or pay a whole lasagna (because my dad kept asking how much he owes me so I said we can split the check however that was wrong because it was a test if I was willingly going to offer in paying the whole meal) that my mom wanted. They say I’m cheap but I always buy stuff that my family likes even though yeah hurts me but if they want it I will buy it. Right now I guess this is me just to vent. I don’t know what to do to prove to my parents that I’m not cheap and that I have been buying stuff willingly for my mother. My father says I still have Mother’s Day and Christmas to do it correctly I guess. But for today my moms birthday I got her a necklace that said mom and a birthday card. It stresses me out because they say that I haven’t changed but I feel like I’ve doing very small baby steps in changing this bad characteristic of me but they expect me to drastically change because I guess it’s a habit that they never taught me to break at a young age. I don’t think I’m a penny pincher but I know it hurts when my bank account goes down but I mean I know my mom would do the same for me in buying stuff that I would like. I’m horrible with presents and sometimes I wish my mom could give me strong hints in what she wants and give me an idea what to give her. But can someone help out on how to change this habit and prove my parents I’m not a cheapskate on my mom for special occasions or when she is wanting them. And how can I be more aware on what she wants.,1
"I've lost my best friend I've pretty much been alone this past month and a half. My best friend and boyfriend of 2 and a half years told me that we would be taking a short break for his mental health, I know how hard life can be and that his situation also sucked so I after many a tear went a long with it, even though I felt it was a little over board. I love this man with all my heart and soul and I hoped that he would be okay as I know his depression episodes get bad when not delt with quick and I was always there to help when available. After a few weeks I tried texting a few friends (one thing you must know about me is I'm not very popular and don't have many friends and just started at a new school) one friend helped me out the best they could but recently have just trailed off and left me here... during this time, not only was my family involved in so much crap on both sides but many a family member are sick, my car legitimately broke down, my phone broke itself, and I have no one who really is there for me. I'm all alone now... It feels so difficult to do anything, even get up. Now that I've lost my best friend in the whole world after going through so many other trammatic relationships (I was abused in 2 other relationships) I feel like a waste of a person. I feel like him saying he's coming back is a lie that he told me to maybe give me a false since of hope and happiness, but then again I don't know... I really want to believe what he's saying is true but it's almost been 2 months now. I really just feel like my feelings have been disregarded and that I'm always the one who cares the most about everyone, now that they're all gone I don't feel okay... I feel so lonely... I just want my best friend back...I know reddit is a strange place to go with this but I have no good options left and the people here seem like they're pretty chill. Anyways, that's my story...",1
"Feeling very stressed out lately? Hi, i need to vent a little bit. I started a job at an Amazon Fulfillment center in November 2018. Anyways, I am at my wits end with this job. I am not really good at what I do their and they know that (I cant for the life of me pick 400 items an hour due to all the jams I get or pod gapping but its always my fault). I got sent home early two days ago because “i suck”. I even got asked if I like the job I have and the process assistant complained to me no matter how much they help out I dont improve. It hurts. Even though I moved out and have enough money to last until I get another job I have lined up I asked my mom her opinion on quitting but she tells me I should stay only because I need the health insurance until I can get on my fiancés in October (when we get married) then quit but she feels bad for me since I am going crazy. I should be working right now but the bus was too packed and skipped my stop( i dont drive). What should I do? Just quit? Listen to my mom?I know I need health insurance and the job pays well but like I said I am at my wits end with everything. This is the worst place I worked for. I know another place to apply for insurance thats near where I live(i already enquired information from them if I was to get that insurance) l, I already have another job I can get more days added until this other new job I am getting calls me for orientation class (they want to hire a few more people to have a full class) Im literally end up crying thinking about going in and I feel like quitting is wrong but like I said I cant take it no more.",1

"This shadowed figure, he follows me everywhere. I don't know if its a friend or a foe, But he is making my life a mess...He won't leave me alone. Since birth I have seen this...""**Figure.**"" It was as young as me and the more years I lived, the bigger it became and the more it learned. It was a black and grey figure, bright grey eyes, its arms thin with sharp claws, and missing legs that had purple mist grow from where they should have been. It appeared more frequently every passing day. I told people about it, but nobody wished to believe me. When I told people, they responded with ""*Well, does this 'thing' have a name? If its so real, it must have one.*"" Sadly, I didn't know its name, but one day I built the courage to ask it. I met it in a forest by my house, in private, I asked for its name and why it was always following me. He came close to me and spoke to me. ""*I go by many names,* ***Sadness, Despair, Depression.*** *But in your case, call me...****Autism****.""* Autism said he was connected to me since birth, an accidental life. Back then, I thought he was just a person nobody understood like me, so I let him stay with me. But now, Autism has almost ruined my life. He began forcing me to be different. Separating me from people I cared about and those who cared for me. I didn't believe I could save myself from him. He always held me close, trapped me in strings with hooks that dug into my bones. He used them whenever he wished, and made me a puppet. Whenever he took me over I became ***Aggressive, Harmful, Dangerous.*** I always begged him to leave me alone, but he just laughed and reminded me that we were stuck together. One day, I had had enough. I finally faced the shadow that took me over, and I ***reconciled*** with it. I knew it wouldn't leave, even if I told it to. I asked for it to try and change, to listen to me, to help me become unique, to help me be normal, not a monster, ***to make me a person.*** He stared back at me, and apologized to everything he had done, he had just wanted me to act his way. We spoke until we finally reached an agreement. I had thought my life was turning around. I was making friends, Becoming active, succeeding in school. Although he would return to his habits sometimes, he kept his word and had become a friend of my own. When I introduced people to him some weren't impressed, but most liked him and thought he was interesting. It was working out...until now... I had believed 2020 would be the worst year of my life, because of the events the world is facing. But it ended up being the following year, 2021. My Mother had not been in the greatest of conditions. She was stuck in the hospital due to a mass in her stomach and fluids filling her insides. She was getting better every day, to a point where we could take her back home. (She stayed on a hospital bed at the house though.) I was going to high school one day, when my step dad told me he had the Virus. We lived about 6 streets away from out grandparents, so me and my brother went to live with them until he got better, taking care of my Mother who was still at the house. My Grandparents told me we were going back to check on them, Autism was really nervous about what would happen, but I ignored him. We got there and we said hello to them. Then our stepdad told us the worst news ever, our mom would pass away in the next two days to a week. I was fully aware this was an opportunity to happen, I was already prepared for this, my brother wasn't as much. So today was the day we would say goodbye to her. I won't go into much detail about here, but when we left back to our Grandparents house. I went upstairs and saw Autism sitting on the bed, Sad. I tried to comfort him. Every time I was about to cry, he would tell me ""Crying will not help, its hard to keep the sadness in, but do not shed tears for anybody in front of anybody. It will only make it worse."" These events on my Mom have happened a few days ago, and is about to pass away. I will also state that I am 14 years old and is confessing this here because I need help...I don't know if I should listen to him or not, I really want to let all my emotions out. But I can't...not with him around.....",1
"I can't sleep at night anymore So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any< I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works.

"I have no sleep. Ever since I got in my second quad master, everything went out smoothly. But there was this project I had for the design course that took me the whole Christmas break to do. (I only had 2 weeks of that break) Since it was a plushie project, my teacher expects us to have a sewing machine at home. I didn't have one so I sew it all by hand. I would stay up until 6 am to work on it then wake up at 8 am to sew again, by doing all of that myself I pushed back all of my other units for my other course and now I have fallen behind a lot.. I would always make a schedule for my day but then I have interruptions such as how my mom would get mad at me for not getting my work on time then goes on to say she's gonna take my electronics away? IDK she's gonna make me fail either way if she ever does that again. Then I have a boyfriend that I've been with for a year and a few months now, in October 2020 he did a suicide attempt and I felt so useless not being there in person. Which of course I broke down, didn't do my work for the whole night, didn't eat anything, and when my mom walked into my room when I had my break down and she made a happy expression that I broke up with him. I told her about it and she didn't care and left my room. 2 hours later he was alive and well and I felt relieved but now I feel more paranoid that he would do that again. People say that taking breaks is good when you're stressed. But I can't take any breaks, I'm behind in my subjects and I only have this week and 3 more weeks until I have to move on to the next quadmester. After that, outstanding work from that unit will become a 0.",1
"Managing stressful situations that are actually very important? I have a company that deals with wholesale international trade. Anyone who has ever bought something online already knows how much things can get delayed. If your Amazon Prime toothbrush gets delayed a day, whatever shrug it off right? What if your girlfriend's birthday present is lost or stuck in customs? A little more frustrating right? Now what if your entire shipment of tens of thousands of perishable goods is a week late while all your competitors start getting theirs? That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about. It's easy to say just don't dwell on the things that are out of control. Don't ruminate on the problems and instead focus on solutions... Etc. But when it's a pretty impactful event in your life with potential long term consequences it's easier said than done. I mean logically, in theory having negative thoughts about said event does nothing to change the outcome.

My brain just starts to get so stressed i start to get disturbing intrusive images that will make me go get distracted so i can stop having them, but that doesnt make any of my work disappear, so of course that will make me accumulate work and then have to either work for weeks without rest or have a breakdown and fail on my projects. When i overwork myself, its to a point where i will need to rest for several days after, which can make me go to the ''get distracted and avoid doing work'' phase because my brain just doesnt want to go through several days like that again.

"My 3 month hiatus after a mental breakdown is about to end I've always been depressed/anxious for as long as I can remember, but this past year, my mental health has been at a severe all time low. I quit my really great job 3 months ago because I had a mental breakdown and literally felt like I was going crazy and couldn't handle anything at all. I've always been work motivated and have never not had a job since I was a teenager (I'm 30 now.) The last 3 months have been incredibly difficult to say the least. I've been seeing a therapist and I've tried 9 different antidepressants/antipsychotics in the last like 6 months. Nothing has helped. I sleep most of the day every day. I haven't needed hospitization thankfully, however my husband and I have definitely discussed the possibility of me needing to be admitted and there have been times that I was very close to going. I've had to have him hide my propanolol (I take as needed for panic attacks/anxiety) because I was suicidal and fantasizing about overdosing. I just started Trintellix (in addition to Lamictal) about 2 weeks ago. For the first week or two of taking most of the medications I've tried, it has always seemed to help at least a little bit. I'm assuming that's just a placebo effect because I want it to help so badly. But they always stop helping and I go back to my bedridden, severely depressed self. The last week or so, I've actually felt better than I have in the last few months. I'm not 100% of course and I still have a hard time getting myself motivated to do shit, but I actually feel like there is a possibility of me being able to get things done. I feel like there is a 150 lb weight on top of me instead of a 200 lb weight on top of me. I'm really, REALLY scared it's not going to last like all the rest of the medications though. Long story short, I finally got a job. A good one that I'm excited about. I start in 20 days. I'm looking back at the last few months and looking at how I'm feeling now. I really really want to start this job while feeling at least okay. I know that once the excitement of the job passes, the depression will probably creep back up, but I'm hoping it'll be at least manageable. I don't want to fuck it up and have to stop working again. I'm trying to think of ways I can prepare mentally before I start- what kind of habits I should try to start getting into ahead of time so I don't find myself too overwhelmed and unable to handle anything. I've been so severely depressed the last 3 months and I'm not going to be able to stay in bed all day when I start this job. It's going to be exhausting if I don't make changes now.

For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first. My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past. My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippled nor do I have friends to help me. My doctor’s visit is under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately, they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral. I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time and will use all personal part-time money to pay for whatever else. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked up by my parents. I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?",1
"MY FAILURES MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY. I DON'T FEEL WORTHY TO HAVE FRIENDS OR BE AROUND FAMILY. ITS UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONVICTING. I just want to be successful already so this pain can go away. They say money can't make you happy, well money can solve most of my problems and most importantly I feel it will give my the confidence to truly be myself around people. I feel so bad that im such a disappointment to my family that Im scared to even show my face. Its hard to have or be with friends with no confidence in myself because Im not sure of myself and I have no confidence. I feel worthless, useless.",1
Stressed and overwhelmed I’m sorry this is a ramble. In the immediate time only In a few hours I’ll be starting college for the first time and in a few days I’ll be getting all of my wisdom teeth take Out and on top of it all my work schedule does not match up with my school schedule so I might be forced to quite and look for a new job that can accommodate my schedule. I’m super nervous and anxious about starting in a brand new school with people I don’t know and a place I’ve not really gotten to see tomorrow. I have had at least a couple near panic attacks thinking about my upcoming dental surgery this week (I’m afraid of needles among other things at medical places). How do I calm my mind about these things and stop stressing about it?,1
"I told my mum about my suicide attempt and she didn't care I have been abused by my parents since I was a little child, but I love them for some reason. I finaly had the courage to tell my mum about my depression and how her abuse harmed me. I told her that I'm getting therapy and that I attempted suicide before. I thought that she might finaly care, but instead she shamed me she threw away my pills, told me that I'm ""the rotten egg of the family"", told me that I'm selfish for attempting suicide because if I died that will bring shame to the family and threatned to disown me.

I'm becoming worse by the time passes, I can't think, remember, focus, relax. I want to solve this problem but I can't get out of this situation and I'm about to explode. I have 2 weeks to work on a lot of responsibilities but I don't have any strength in myself anymore. When I have time in my hands I can't work anything neither I can have fun by doing my favourite activities. It stops me living in the time, I literally can't do anything because I can't think anymore. Otherwise I don't feel I'm under heavy pressure, I became so numb.

"Not sure how to keep going Lately, I'm so depressed and I have times where I can't feel any happiness about anything. I cant feel hope. I want to die sometimes, but really I can't because who would take care of my pets? I can't let them down that way. But going on feels so bleak. And it's hard. The biggest issue at the moment is my boyfriend and I. When we started dating, we both had sex with other people and we were both fine with that. I guess you'd call us ""swingers"". The people I had sex with didn't get along with my boyfriend. They started avoided me and I didn't get almost any sex anymore, while my boyfriend still did. This upset me. I felt like it was unfair. My boyfriend pointed out he's not the easiest to get along with and he warned me this might happen when we started dating. Finally, I said I wanted to close our relationship because it didn't feel fair anymore. Now there's a ton of resentment on both sides because we both feel like the other ""ruined"" what we had. I don't know anymore. All I know is, the closeness isn't the same, I feel like crap, my body image is terrible because all these guys used to love having sex with me and then all the sudden no one wanted to anymore. My self esteem is rock bottom. I keep second guessing- was it wrong of me to close the relationship? But I know I was miserable before. Thing is, I'm still miserable now. This is all exacerbated because a lot of my friends were couples who I had sex with. Then, when all this happened, those friendships dissolved. And I moved to live with my boyfriend a year ago when I lost my parents, so most of my non lifestyle (swinging is often referred to as the lifestyle) friendships broke off in the move.. So now I have no friends. Also, during covid, about a year ago,, I lost both my mom and dad. It was very hard on me.. He lost his brother 3 months ago in car accident- he lived with us when he died and I was the one who answered the door when the police came to tell us. It was very hard on both of us, but of course more so on him. I have no family left. I feel so alone. In this house with my boyfriend, who I dont feel close to anymore. Sometimes I feel like he ruined my life, because before we met I had a good life and was happy. I think he feels the same way sometimes too. I don't even know which of us is right anymore. All I know is, everything is dark. I have no connection anymore with anyone. Nothing is fun anymore. I cant afford therapy. I earn decent money, but the way the US health system works, it would still be hundreds of dollars a month even with insurance. Anyone have any actually helpful things to say? I feel trapped in a box with no way out. Even dying isn't the answer. I don't want to do that to my pets. I don't think my boyfriend would keep them if I died. I never feel like doing anything. I just feel empty. I have no connection to anything. Please help me feel like life is worth living again. That's probably a lot to ask. Idk anymore.",1

"I’m sad, I feel like I need a friend I’ve been crying all day neglecting my collage work because I feel really lonely, I feel like I have no one to talk too. Yeah I have “friends” from high school but we never go out of our way to talk, and those conversations usually end quick. I have a boyfriend and He has friends that he goes to hang out with but I’m here at the end of the day by myself. Yeah it’s nice for him to ask me if he can hang out with his friends but it’s been everyday now and he only spend times with me when we eating something which last about 50 mins and then he ask if he could leave and go to his friends and play games. I don’t think it would be that much of a problem if I had friends, like yeah he likes to invite me to play with them but they aren’t my friends. It would be cool to have someone that I could talk to that cared about me and could distract me from myself. I’m just so sad. I need help, I don’t want to rely on my boyfriend being my only friend , especially when we argue and then not talk cause he can just have fun with his friends, while I on the other hand suffer and cries the whole day",1
"Is it normal to feel stressed while doing things that used to relax me? Just like everyone else, my life's been pretty stressful the last year. Ive usually dealt with stress and anxiety by doing relaxing things (to me) like looking at memes, reading, and playing the piano (I'm very bad at it, but I like to follow YouTube tutorials) Recently I've noticed that anytime I've tried to learn a new piece or do something more complex while playing, I've immediately become very anxious, my heart beat speeds up, and I get very uncomfortable. This is all very weird because I've never had these ""panic attack"" type things (I know it's not a real panic attack, and I'm not trying to diminish a real one, it's just the best ""euphemism"" I can come up with), and I've never had a problem learning more complex things on the piano. Is it normal to eventually feel stressed by something that used to do the opposite? Theres no one forcing me to play the piano, no obligations to it, and nothing that should make me feel stressed about it.",1

I’ve been seeing shadowy figures out of the corner of my eye. Dark shadows of people standing over me staring intently. Animals scurrying across the floor or road. Sometimes just moving dots and lights. Recently I’ve been having very vivid dreams which alternate between watching myself commit suicide, or watching myself commit the murder of my significant other.

"Lacking the will to keep going, it's been like this for too long I've tried everything in the past – medication, psychotherapy, etc., but I just can't improve my life. I was first diagnosed in 2005 and there have certainly been good and bad times since then, but one thing I've never been able to overcome is that I'm lazy. I simply lack the willpower to even do basic things. I am approaching my 30th birthday and I'm nowhere near where I want to be in life and with no realistic prospects of being there any time soon. I don't own a home, I'm so far off being ready to marry my girlfriend, no kids, struggling to get my career off the bottom rung of the ladder. I've been plagued by thoughts of ending it all for quite a while now and, to be honest, the only thing keeping me here is that I can't inflict that pain on people who care about me. But existing for the sake of preventing others' pain is so far from a satisfying or meaningful existence. I have no idea how to turn this around and the passage of time will only make this worse as I continue this unsatisfying existence. I'm not on the brink yet, but the longer this goes on, the closer I feel I'll get and I feel so helpless as I watch myself deteriorate.",1

"19year old In need of help and guidancr Hi everyone, I'm a 19year old male just finished highschool. I will get straight to the point College is too expensive. parents can't afford it, even if they can I wouldn't want to burden them. I will want to pay for my own college. But the problem right now is that my parents are retired. I'm really worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I can't help them because my parents don't allow me to get a job because of the covid. I know I'm an adult but I don't have a driving license or a car yet. So instead I'm just learning to code day till night every single day. I need at least 6month to be job ready. I hope that I can get a front end job by then. I have many things to learn ( web design, color theory, SEO, coding etc). I have only just started learning to code 1month ago. I feel so stupid and idiotic for not starting it earlier. Negative thoughts have been haunting me recently, Is like I develop another personality. This personality only thinks of the bad thing for example like wanting to stab someone / myself, thinking of parents passing away etc. This kind of thoughts is appearing more often with each day passing. Also there is a side of me that feel like I'm missing out because all of my friends and classmate are all in college. This kind of negative thinking didn't appear at all when I was in school but because I heard from parents that they don't have enough money. Is been bothering me ever since I won't blame my parent and I know where I am now, I will work my way to get it but my headache and stress is getting worse every passing day, Im not taking any day off. Im very worried that my parents won't have enough money to pay rent. I'm worried that I won't have enough time to learn the things needed. I'm really scared that my parent 60+yo will passed away early. All of this is stressing me out really badly I want to help them but I don't know how I can help. I don't have allowance. Worse is that I don't have any skill or talent. I feel like I don't have enough time to learn the things I need to learn because there so many. Sometimes it doesn't even get absorbs by my head because I'm rushing it. Also recently I've been biting my nail and scratching my head till bleeding. I never had this habit before.",1

"my boyfriend is severely depressed, and sent me the following texts. please tell me, what should i do? it breaks my heart to see him like this.

I have known for months that it is a lost and absurd battle that is not worth fighting and things have happened accordingly and got worse. We could not do it separately, nor together, we could not do it in more favorable situations, we cannot do it now it would simply be absurd. It would be better for you to dedicate your time to yourself or anything else.” “It is simply useless already, it was useless half a year ago and it is now more than ever. There’s no need on making a great effort if it has to be useless.” “I consider the help (not yours but from anyone) useless given the situation, and I think time has proved me right.” “Everything has gone from bad to worse, it would be absurd to think that things could work out.” “In December I told you that no matter how much you wanted it was not viable, that it would become a struggle between you and depression and that we could not win in any way, and everything has happened like this, I am able to distinguish my thoughts from reality yet.” It is very heartbreaking to see him like this. He has said these things to me many times, so it doesn’t come as a surprise to me that he thinks this way, but it is still hard. He always ends up coming back to me, and I want to be supportive of him and do whatever I have to do best so it allows him to feel at least a bit safer with me. 59 feel that he is actually not alone and that getting better is not impossible, but he keeps pushing me away. what should I really do?",1

"my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat. i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you ) (please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)",1

As the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light to the darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photo synthesis to plants, and security to humans. It's for this reason that as far back as 14,000 8.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cave walls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to name just a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source of enlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it has significant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun are related by electromagnetic fields. On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between the sun's energy, the Earth's energy, and the energy of all living species. On a micro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit or vegetable to understand this interdependence. Consciously absorbing that energy to combine with your own Spiritual Energy has tremendous benefits for your astral body, physical health and much more. Your spiritual energy goes under many different names like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more. Here's a 3 minute [YouTube video]( expanding more on the benefits and how to, actually absorb the energy from the sun, through your own self-induced voluntary goosebumps from positive events/thoughts/memories/feelings.",0
"I feel like an empty shell That’s pretty much it, honestly. I’m a person who gets bored so, so easily; of books, games, shows, physical hobbies, and even, or especially, people. Nearly everything I’ve had a consistent obsessive interest in has to do with psychology or neuroscience, all so I could find out *something* about myself. The Thing. Answers. Relief. But really, I’m just… normal, boring, with extremely unrealistic expectations. It’s like I’m a broken bucket, no matter what and how much I add to my life, I’d be left with nothing. Within hours. A few days if I’m lucky. Sure, I feel lonely, but I have damn good friends, we’re close, we connect so well. I have a great support system. Yet, I’m more likely to avoid all that. Because it’s not stimulating enough, or perhaps not stimulating in the right ways, nothing personal. What are the right ways? Absolutely no idea. At the end of that day, I find myself back to the void, whether I’m pulled back into it forcefully or… idk, I sought it out myself out of fear, seeking familiar comfort, doesn’t really matter. Oh I know, this will pass, something will spark my interest eventually, but I will come back to the emptiness after. It’s a cycle, clearly, and I’m simply so very tired of reliving it and being stuck.",1

"I’m freakin out man Hey Reddit, I just searched for this sub so that I could vent a little. I’m pretty stressed right now about my finances and I’d just like to type mindlessly for a few minutes. I have a very steady and regular income with no fear of losing my job any time soon. I love what I do, and it pays... better than anything I’ve ever done before it. Due to the nature of things, I have to schedule vacations a year out, and being relatively young and naive, I decided it would be a good idea to schedule time off in July for my birthday and to visit my family in Kansas City area, and then again August to see my family in Alaska. Each trip was a week long. Some of you may already see the error of my ways. I was semi-prepared for the vacation in July, but it wasn’t until after the trip that I realized the flight for my wife and I to Alaska was going to be about double what I was expecting. Needless to say, I was financially unprepared for the trip but already committed, tickets in hand. The trip itself was a dream, and I loved every minute of it. Near the end of my trip, I realized just how unprepared I was, when I woke up and had $45 in my bank account. I still needed to drive home after my flight(in order to save about $300, I drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me. Cost of gas was about $70 round trip, for a total savings of about $225... it was worth it to me). Due to this and the fact I still had some bills to pay, I headed over to /r/Borrow and took out a loan(which I have since paid back). That covered me until I got paid.... until yesterday when I realized I was yet again behind, causing me to take another loan out(less than before so I guess I am technically ahead?). I sent out a check for my mortgage and it bounced, I’m a month behind on bills, and I’m practically living at biolife(plasma donation) right now trying to make ends meet. I transferred $35 into my bank account from my biolife cards so my mortgage check would go through. I’m at my wits end and don’t see a solution in sight. I’m stressed beyond belief. Please don’t comment on here telling me I’m a shithead for not managing my finances well... I know that and next month after I get paid, I’m doing absolutely nothing extra. Shit I might live on ramen this month if I have to. I need help dealing with this stress and really could use some help. Anything.",1

"“JuSt Go tO ThErApY” I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country. It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I. /rant Tldr therapy isn’t easy to get into and isn’t cheap. “Go to therapy” is not a solution many people can take.",1
I rarely be able to concentrate on studying when there are people around me in public. I can’t even concentrate on studying when I’m home though it’s better. But I can’t concentrate on studying when there are people chattering around me. It makes me so much stressed out. What can I do for this?,1

"I wish I didn't wake up today. So, this is my first time posting here. Or being here, in fact. But I don't know where else to go. It's only 9 12 AM where I live as I'm writing this. I'm in the middle of online class. I woke up at 2 AM and couldn't sleep again, so I decided to go to YouTube to kill time. Between 5 and 6 AM, I've listened to a few songs that only made me feel really sad and brought back bad memories, including one that I've frequently thought that I should listen to in case I try to kill myself in a way that wasn't instant. At this point, my suicidal thoughts only got worse and worse, to the point I actually pointed a knife to my neck, honestly thinking whether I should push in or pull away, but I'm too much of a coward to actually do anything. I've decided to check a few old texts and saw that my girlfriend sent me a text. I don't think it's in my right to share what it said in public, but... While she didn't say it explicitly, it's heavily implied that she cheated on me. And I can't help but think about how much this hurts. So I asked what the fuck she meant by that, and all I can do now is wait for an answer and hope that I'm just a bad person to even think that she did that, and that she didn't do what I think she did. And now, I'm here, in the middle of class, thinking what the fuck is the point of all of this, just wishing I didn't wake up at all today just so I wouldn't feel all this pain. I just want to stop hurting, even for a moment, but nothing is helping.",1
Already stressed about my final year at university and I haven’t even started In a few weeks I go back to university for my fourth year and I’m already dreading and anxious in advance about how stressed I’m going to be. Everything that happens I’m worried it’s going to have a knock on effect on how well I do. For example the issues my family has been having. I put so much pressure on myself to do well and always have as I don’t want these 4 years to have been for nothing,1
"I feel like I’m screaming for help and no one is listening I’ve been trying to get better. Really trying. I’ve met with doctors to adjust my meds. I’ve missed 3 weeks of work getting all that shit sorted out, and trying to prioritize my mental health. Only to miss 3 weeks of pay and stress myself out more. As if 3 weeks could fix the 10 years of depression. I feel like everyone underplays how I’m feeling when I try to talk about it. I can’t decide if I want to just disappear, or end it. My family only cares about me getting back to work. It’s always been about just getting back to work. A job that I don’t even get a lunch break during, and no other breaks throughout the day. I’m a teacher. For 6th graders. Do I like my job? Yeah. Is it worth sacrificing even 10 minutes to get a deep breath and thought process in? Not so sure. Yet everyone this whole time has just asked “when do you go back to work?” Not how am I doing, how am I feeling, just when do I start making money again and being a productive member of society. Or “do it for the kids” and sometimes I just want to scream that maybe I need to make a decision FOR ME. I think the kids will be more traumatized if they learn their teacher off-ed herself because she realized it’s all fucking pointless. No one understands unless they’re going through it. Yet everyone wants to tell you what to do. They won’t say it but I know my parents and my boyfriend just think I’m weak and dramatic. My best friend at this point is my damn dog (who is the BEST boy and I really think the only reason I’ve held on this long). I’m at the point where I know I really want it all to end. But I wish a lightening bolt would just come down and do it for me so at least I won’t have died in a way that proves I am in fact just a weak loser. It sucks because I know I have passions and ambitions but they don’t align with the way everyone else wants me to live my life. And the cherry on top my fucking roommate is the most negative person I’ve ever met and leaves notes around the house about how much everything sucks! I’m negative too and agree everything sucks but goddammit I’m trying here and that’s not helpful. Even if it is sitting next to a fall scented candle. I can’t escape the depression and the negativity and I’m just so fucking exhausted!!!!!!!",1

"My parents are splitting up. I’m 20 and was abused by my father all my life and I’m still living with them Because I got diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer and I’m a recovering benzo addict. So honestly I could care less that my father is leaving us. I’m just worried about how my sister will handle this. Both my parents were opiate addicts and my sisters the only one who hasn’t done hard drugs, only weed. She’s 15 and has significant mental health issues. I also have mental health problems, I’m diagnosed bipolar 1 , PTSD, and GAD. With that being said I need to escape this fighting because it’s causing me to isolate in my room, having straight up flashbacks of my dad beating me and my mom.

"Anyone else's depression made worse by the way the world is?

I'm angry I'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job I dont like, I'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. Ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years I get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when I can travel which is the only thing I'm interested in anymore. Probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on YouTube making millions for being morons while I have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off.  I get the whole ""life isnt fair"" thing but I can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse.",1
"Can someone read this ? It’s my full story If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life. I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then. Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade My existential crisis began. 11th grade suicide attempts. 12 burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me — Thank you for reading. I’m grateful to whoever took the time out to read this. Sorry it was long. Edit- I really want to thank all of you for the kind words. Really I do.

I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again? It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends.

I feel like I'm not growing or I didn't grew at all I'm shorter than my coevals. My penis size is embarrassingly small. And in this young age I have a visually perceivable hair loss. I don't know. Tonight I'm sad with my hairs and that's why I decided to write. And I don't know what you people can help with but. I just feel sad and shitty. Maybe hair can be cured but I don't know anything about it tho. They started falling when I grew em longer than usually I use, and when I cutted them again they just didn't stop to. Now when I look into mirror and see baldy parts I hate my life. And I know this stress just makes everything worse but I want to have a normal penis, a not falling hair ( at least at my fucking 17th year ) and a nice college life but it seems I'm far far away from all of these. Also I'm fat and I want to exercise and shit but first I need to get start from somewhere with studying and then I think I can make all of these with an order. In the end it still seems like I can't do anything with the other 2 things. I don't know if it's the right place to write this down but I think I'm depressed since my 7th grade because just how life basically works. Thank you for reading have a nice day.",1
I haven’t taken my meds in a while probably not good… but like idk i guess i kinda like it. this is self destructive i should take them. why do i do this to myself?,1
"Exercise or activities that physically tire you might reduce your stress Increasing the intensity of my exercise helped reduce my stress. I hope this suggestion will help you too. I have been crazy stressed since 2012. It got so bad last year that I couldn't stop over thinking and would get really upset about things. I tried talking to someone, journaling, mild exercise, colouring books, meditation, chanting, etc... everything helped a little but for the most part the stress was still affecting my sleep, motivation and outlook on things. Recently I was out and about with friends, walking in the sun and taking in nature. I was so exhausted by the end of it, that my stress and constant thinking stopped. The next morning I was still quite calm. So I decided to start walking 4km per a day to maintain that level of calm. It's been a week and so far so good. I fall asleep within minutes of getting into bed and I am still calm the next morning. I had to deal with a stressful situation today but I was so calm, I was able to add humour and make everyone else feel relaxed as well.",1
"Uncontrollable phrases? Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"". Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough? Edit thanks for all the comments today wasn't the best day for me or week for that matter. Y'all comments made me feel a little better.

"Self-sabotage I like to think I’m good at managing whenever depression hits but lately reality proved otherwise. I’m at the final stages of writing my masters thesis which is due by the end of September and while I had pretty good head start with only the intro left to write and results and discussion mostly done, I know realize I spent the last three weeks avoiding it with all my might. Whenever I think about writing my heart starts racing and I just shut down, lay on my bed and don’t even turn my computer on. I told my supervisor that by now I’d have it mostly finished and now I feel like a total failure who is only able of disappointing people. I feel myself spiralling and don’t know how to stop.",1

"I dont want to live anymore, medical hell rant. I've been feeling really stressed and depressed with everything going on in my life lately. I graduated college a few years ago and I cant find a job in my field. they dont want to take their chances with someone who has little experience. All of them usually try to require AAA game experience or 3+ years experience. I went for game development with an art emphasis. I've been trying to get out of my current manufacturing job since It has been causing me alot of stress. Not only that but I have so many health problems going on. I got my tubes tied last year hoping it would help with depression. Since I wouldnt be on meds anymore. But after surgery I was throwing up and shaking for almost 10 hours. It was a vary painful recovery, and it still hurts sometimes. Then a few months later I had a bad flare of vasculitis. We dont know what caused it. Could.it be my juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, my surgery, the clips they put in during surgery, stress, or my medication. We dont know. Not only dont we not know but I feel like my doctors have given up. I got a response from a nurse saying that these things just happen sometimes.... my legs have scarring from the vasculitis, and they keep coming and going. 2 different arthritis meds and other meds to attempt to suppress it... I feel like it's not working or helping. I want to give up and cancel all my appointments and stop taking my meds Then because of my depression over the years I havnt been taking care of myself.. I have had 6 fillings so far this year. 2 are still painful. And the dentist keeps trying to ""fix it"" but I feel like he his causing more problems. Not only that but they refuse to do anything about holes on one of my back molars. Then I looked at braces bit I nerd to fix 3 more fillings, then have oral surgery, then have braces put on. Do I even try with how bad my teeth are? Is it worth it when they are all going to fall out anyways.. I feel like I'm not getting anywhere anymore, I just turned 24 this last Thursday... I feel so lost and hopeless. I need advice, or just anything...",1
Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard. Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn’t the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it’s been years and I’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I’m proven wrong. Edit it’s been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments. Those of you who commented or will comment I see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together.,1
"Being traumatised by a depression..(?) Hi guys, First time posting here, but read over the years here and there some posts.. Well as in the title here my situation 3 years ago I started analytic therapy, had a girlfriend that time and some heavy anxiety made things very difficult. (My father died when I was 14, which made it later then hard to love someone without fear) Well it went really good actually till 2020 The relationship was a lil toxic for me, it had a very polarising dynamic.. it made me depressive - September 2020 came along and one day to another it hit me with panic, cry attacks, mental breakdowns I started taking medication, Elontril (US is wellbutrin or something).. it’s simply a Bupropion Derivate.. nevermind It was heavy and after a long path of heavy pain I never experienced in my life before the relationship ended. Now since March a long and slow positive trend happened I basically have no social anxiety what so ever. Talking to many people and going out actually helps me. I also have barely heavy self doubts. I like myself and I think I don’t deserve this depression at all. My main thing is Hopelessness.. that it is or will be chronic. That it never ends and I will end up having it forever I have a strong family and friends holding my back and all those actually positive things should make my depression way better or push me out of that.. But it doesn’t which worries me even more. Now I experience a small downwards spiral again..(well I am studying physics and it’s stressful recently- so there might be the reason) Now to my big worries (which may be part of depressive thoughts person_shrugging face_with_raised_eyebrow ) The biggest cause of all my shit at the moment is a clearly noticeable wrong affection. I see something or feel something or smell something and a depressive feeling comes up.. no “I hate my self” or “I don’t deserve etc”. No thinking problem. Rather a feeling problem. It is simply just that my own reality seems heavily distorted and I am so good damn fucking afraid of another hell like late 2020.. it makes me panic to think about that happening again.. This depression traumatised more than anything in my distant past.. my depression gave me such a trauma, that it seems to stay. It induced it self.. And I have such a fear, that there is now solution to this at all.. I don’t see me as a person how is always struggling with depression It can’t be. I do except that I am in that position now and a part of me also thinks that every single soul on this planet can overcome an endogene Depression (non psychiatric) for good. Everyone must find there own way but I feel how this mental state fades recently and it gives me instant panic because depression-trauma. Has anyone also such a concrete feeling of being traumatised by the depression itself? Is there a way to deal with that. To break that circle? (I have to add that I WAS a hypochondriac but psychoanalysis made it almost go away but I think it is focused now on the depression yall fee me? No idea how to deal with that)",1
"At my lowest It’s my mother’s birthday and my father planned her this surprise party and everything is going great, everything’s perfect. As grateful as I am for them being in my life and then being amazing parents, I can’t help but just not want to be present at the party. I’d rather be home. Everyone is currently singing and there’s this Mariachi’s band playing and I just can’t help but cry. I can’t socialize anymore, I said hello to family but I just don’t feel comfortable being here anymore. I wish I was, I wish I could be happy and cheering them on but instead, I’m crying writing a post of Reddit because I don’t know what else to do other than be on my phone and ignore the fact that I’m not someone people or family talk to during these events. I can’t help but to believe I’m not here, emotionally or mentally. I just can’t connect myself anymore. What is wrong with me? Am I even crying?",1
"How do I deal with school with depression? So I'm going into the 10th grade this year (which for some of you is year 11), but I'm very worried about how I'll be able to keep on top of school. Last school year I barely did anything at all -- I couldn't. The beginning of my academic downfall was when I was taken into a residential programme to deal with a series of mental problems. During and when I got out I felt too morbidly depressed to do pretty much anything, especially school work. I would never shower, never brush me teeth, never flush the toilet, never clean my bedroom, (you know the routine). My school is very demanding, but I was lucky that the faculty was aware that I wasn't able to be as ahead as my peers which helped because it felt as if everything was far too overwhelming to do and I physically could not without my head hurting or something of the sort. Now that summer is over and school is starting again, I have no idea how I'm going to manage keeping on top of my work. I do really want to try my best this year but I can barely complete or start my first few assignments without getting insanely overwhelmed. This year I won't get the same leniency as I did last year, and honestly I can't say I want it either because it too came with its downsides. Other kids would get angry at me because I was exempt from doing some assignments, and also it made me feel as if I'd failed at being a human along with everything else. I could barely keep on top of my hygiene, I wouldn't eat, I could barely get out of bed or look the slightest bit decent when leaving the house. It was as if I was a baby that had to be carried around due to it's helplessness, I hated it. albeit It was far better than drowning in my own academic failure and being personally held accountable for my lack of effort towards my education. In conclusion, I'm wondering how I can keep on top of school work without getting very overwhelmed due to my depression?",1
"Can't keep doing this (venting) I've always been depressed to some degree since I was very young. I knew there was something wrong with my brain, but whenever I tried to ask my parents for help or to see someone about it, they would brush it off. Now though, years and years later, I do see a psychiatrist and I'm in therapy, but I hit an excruciating swing of depression for the past few weeks. I can't stop thinking about how much I've screwed up my life, how many people I've disappointed, how the things I've done and been through are impossible to come back from. I've lost weight at an extreme speed because I can't gather the motivation to go make myself something to feed myself, or really the motivation to do anything. I think about death a lot. How it could just end this whole cycle. Every minute just drags on and it's messing with my perception of time. And I'm just so TIRED of sleeping, not wanting to do anything but sleep, but then feeling like a failure for not getting anything done. I have a couple friends who check up on me, but I feel like I don't deserve them. I don't wanna bring their mood down, it doesn't feel like I'm being a good friend back. And I just really can't keep doing this, can't keep waking up feeling exactly the same or worse from the day before. I don't know how much longer I can take it.",1

I had one of the lowest scores on my test, a 48/100. I can't get my program assignment to work, while every one else has theirs working like it was no problem, and whenever I ask for help, I feel like the professor is upset at me because it was something we learned about earlier in the semester.

I have nothing to live for as I have lost all my friends and any sort of emotion.

Not like I have access to a gun anyway, but it sort of grounds me into the realty of the situation. I think about my poor mother finding my head exploded like a pumpkin. That would destroy her.

"Hi Hello, I have recently (2 years ago) had a panic attack during a certain recreational activity and i have never been able to recover from it. I am 22 years old studying/living abroad and i am very new to stress, im not even sure it is stress. If i could describe my symptoms then someone would confirm for me... that would be great. It usually starts with thoughts contemplating life and then spirals out of control, even typing it on to this subreddit makes me shudder. Thoughts of imminent doom and uncertainty. I would then go into panic attack mode and wait for the nightmare to be over. Is this stress or psychosis? i sometimes feel im going made. recently i started having night terrors, extremely vivd ones which i can still remember several months after, I've had 3 bad ones so far and sometimes im afraid to go to sleep because of them. I don't wan't to take any medication, i know my family has a history of depression and ive heard about the zombi-fying effect some drugs have. My usual stress reliever has been going to the gym but recently ive been having panic attacks there too. Typing this post has eased my mind somewhat and any comments would probably do the same Regards, Jon",1
"I’m killing myself [update] So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons. I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”",1
"How do I come back from a joke gone poorly? I’m too lazy to make an alt acc or whatever. Last night I went to dinner with some of my coworkers who I was becoming pretty good friends with. I’ll say this now, I was a little under the influence. Over the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with financial struggles, the passing of my grandpa, who was my last grandparent alive, and not being able to leave my house and go hang with other people. Back to last night, things were going okay and we were all having fun, I think. My one pal and I always crack, I guess you could say, “edgy” jokes. He was like “Oh yeah btw guys, (me) is a violently racist person.” It took me a good 30-45 seconds to realize what he said and all my friends were like “(me) what the fuck dude, are not gonna say anything?” I tried to explain that I infact wasn’t and that it was a joke, but it was too late. About 5 min later we were still cracking jokes and we were talking about our newest coworker (she wasn’t with us). My edgy friend asked what ethnicity she was and I said she was African American, because I genuinely thought she was, even though I’ve only interacted with her like 3 times. My very liberal manager got up and said “dude are you fucking retarded?” She had never said something like this to me before so I was caught off guard. My mind was scrambling and I was thinking, “Ok, what is she then? She has to be one of the other ones [ethnicities]” Well my stupid monkey brain said “Oh one of the other ones” out loud and everyone just looked at me. At this moment I knew I was fucked and there was no way of helping myself. Over the next couple hours most of them didn’t really talk to me at all and I could tell that they were genuinely disappointed in me and I felt all of this guilt engulf me. I sent a long message in our group text and only one of them responded saying “yeah man, the stuff you said rubbed us the wrong way and we are not the audience for that.” After that they have yet to talk to me and I have to go work later and I can’t get myself to cheer up at all. Do you guys have any advice. TL;DR I made a ignorant and slightly racist comment while under the influence at dinner with my coworkers and they are very angry at me and aren’t responding to my apologies.",1
"Over the years have developed a Pavlov-esque stress reaction to just multitasking at my computer, typing, sending emails, etc... Very busy and stressful job leads to head pressure, anxiety, severe tension, then detachment...not good. And I’m just working from home! Can’t figure out how to fix this. The multitasking triggers the head pressure and then spirals from there. It lasts even through the weekend and has long term effects. Meditation helps but only very temporarily. After a long vacation it’s better for a while then slip right back into it. Strange... it’s such a tense high blood pressure-like feeling as if what I’m working on has life or death consequences...when it’s just regular financial work.

"43 and completely lost I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct. I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression. I'm so disappointed in the person I've become. No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges. I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations. I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking. I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave. I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years. My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder. I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy. Nothing seems to help. I'm unbelievably critical of myself. Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit. I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written. I'm even more amazed by the responses. How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice? I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained. I can't imagine giving advice to someone. There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress. I'm a mess right now. I have lost hope of getting better. I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day. I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents. Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me. The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since. I have some solid friends that I've known since high school. They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. I can't seem to learn anything these days. I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things. I can't imagine surviving another 40 years. I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer. I've no real skills to rely on. I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day. I no longer think I'm capable of having a family. Too overwhelming. I would be an awful spouse and father. I don't plan to go back to work. I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life. By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them. My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run. I've read so much on coping with this disease. But so little spurs me to action. Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions. The weed stopped working for me though.

My girlfriend broke up with me recently. She said I was a man child and she needed an actual man. I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand. Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt. I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live. I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man. I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway. Edit to everyone young reading this, just try to promise me you'll at least go to school and get a degree, not to impress anyone like most egomaniacs, but just so you have a good job and can get your own place and be proud of yourself. You don't want to end up like be, I promise you that.",1

Has anyone ever felt they won’t ever reach their full potential because of their depression? I would like to hear your thoughts.,1
"Thinking about getting a puppy dog face  I was fine for a long time. But recently my depression has come back and in full swing. Including suicidal ideation. I’m thinking about getting a puppy soon, personally a (healthy, correctly bred) toy chihuahua that I can dress up and take care of and take with everywhere and be my baby. Lol rolling_on_the_floor_laughing it sounds corny but the thought of having an animal that loves you unconditionally and NEEDS you seems like a good emotional support. I’ve had dogs in the past and they were such a great positive influence. Y’all have pets that you love? Helps get you through the day? I know it may not work for everyone, but man_shrugging ",1
"Need better coping mechanisms for stress Whenever I am working on homework and it just isn't making sense or is to hard, I get really stressed and frustrated. I am a stress crier so when this happens I just start sobbing or I get really angry (I have a collection of bad pencils that I snap in half). It is really annoying because it basically incapacitates me for an hour and drains all motivation I had to continue working. This seems really unhealthy and I would love any advice for coping mechanisms I can use to stop this from happening. Thanks",1
"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff. My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way. As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly. My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",1
What would happen when I commit suicide? Like when I survive Can anyone tell me what will happen? I never tried really tried before and I don't plan it this year. Thanks.,1
Does anyone else’s depression keep them up at night? Im jealous of the people that are able to sleep away. I feel the constant stress of being depressed keeps me up till i get really exhausted.

"Is disassociation depression or something else? When my stress gets bumped up to 11/10, I tend to disassociate a lot. I'll read comics/books, listen to music, get lost in my own head, or maybe even dive into food or another (to me) addictive source of dopamine. Overall, just losing my touch with reality. It's like intentionally trying to put blinders on. I'm trying to stay in reality because, in this case, my stress is caused by my long distance fiance getting a job near me, and moving her and myself into an apartment. One element of this is that her family is very much a planning one. My family is very much of a ""get it done asap"" type deal. Whereas she wants a three week process, I'd rather just get it done. Sorry, sidetracked. My question is if disassociating while stressed is a symptom of my depression, or another issue I need to address? Either way, other than a generic ""practice mindfulness"", what is something I can do with a busy schedule to remain in touch with myself?",1

"Found a potential life partner and I couldn't be happier! I met this girl on Hinge - she and I instantly hit it off and had long conversations over text. After a few days I suggested a meetup to continue our conversation in person, and she agreed. We met, ate some food and walked through a park while sharing our lives to eachother. The next date didn't go as well - she was in a different state and it was virtual. I wasn't in the right mindspace and it felt awkward throughout the whole thing. I thought I had ruined it. She even picked up on it and suggested we don't date anymore, but wanted to stay friends and maybe meet up after she got back. A few weeks later, conversation continued and we met up again just to hang out and have fun doing something together. Flirting popped back up between us and it felt like sparks were flying, so at the end of the day I asked if she wanted to try again. She was hesitant and said she'd let me know. A few months later we're still dating, staying over at each others houses, having 10+ hour phone calls and more recently have been recording ourselves reciting books, poems and short stories for the other to fall asleep to when we can't be together or on the phone. This is the first time in a long time I've been this happy with someone else, and I really hope she becomes my forever partner <3",0

A little about why One in three students experience a significant mental health issue when they're in school.

Like I have never known a time that I didn't experience severe recurring depression so it's just fuckin crazy that these people are real? One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.

"I’m so tired. I thought when school reopened and normal learning would commence, I’d be ok. That I’d be away from my family, and I wouldn’t feel so horrible all the time. That was a fucking lie, because apparently school is overwhelming as fuck too. I can’t hold a conversation without overthinking, I embarrass myself and act weird, and this sounds stupid as fuck but I’m terrified of the boys in my class. They’re not dangerous or any of that, they’re just so loud I wonder how they can retain so much life inside of them. I can’t do it.

There’s this kind of prize ceremony at my school where you can win scholarships, but I don’t know if I should try because I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I failed to secure a good future for myself. I mean, I’m still freshman so I shouldn’t put to much emphasis into my future as of yet. I still have time.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do? A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. Here's the breakdown with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",1

"So grateful for my partners support and love. I have always been obsessed with the idea of feeling “at home” and have struggled to truly find it.

"Whining about my past and current state I really don't know what to write, but I somehow have to get this off my chest. Might be a bit of rambling, but I've got nobody to actually talk to (also sorry for some mistakes, german fellow here) Okay, so a little background story. Basically since I'm 12/13 (I'm 22 now) I'm suffering from mental problems, mostly depression. At a time it was also severe social anxiety. I've been in a hospital for it for around 2 months. I got into it because I admitted to contemplating suicide. But basically after getting out it didn't really get better. Why all of that? Well... My parents divorced at a young age. My back then stepdad was an asshole. Nothing was more important to him than his house, car and work. He's my little brothers dad and I guess I don't need to tell you that my big brother and I weren't of big interest for him. We had this big ass house, but nothing was getting done. He was never home, me and my brother went to school, my little brother was a baby, my mom was also working and I had to see her burning out more and more. Then she divorced him after getting back the strength and I got sucked into a lawsuit. He took my little brother and didn't bring him back. So... court appointments, youth welfare office, appraisers... All being at home, wanting to speak to me as well (my back then stepdad said that my mother was not able to keep kids)... If this wasn't enough. My big brother and I also never really had the best relationship since his dad never cared about him and he saw how my dad cared about me. But my dad also is someone who's suffering from some kind of anxiety and maybe I learned from it upside-down_face However... School was never better. I was basically always bullied. Can't remember a time in school this wasn't the case until the last year. And that's it. I got to know a beautiful girl. Apparently I caught her eye and she reached out to me... Three years of a almost perfect relationship. Before that I only had a guy who sexually took advantage of me... It really was a long time I haven't been that happy. She was beautiful, she was smart, funny and so on... But in the end she left me for another dude. This was two years ago and I'm still suffering from it. Not that I want back. I just... Can't start anything new. So let's add ""trust issues"" to the list. But that's not just because of this. After it I tried dating other people. But in the end it was them fucking others while being with me, trying to get their ex bfs jealous or other stuff like that. I kinda got into that spiral of just having meaningless sex with dudes or girls I found on Grindr or Tinder (also I never got to out me and I really regret that). But that was a big problem, because I realized how superficial a lot of people are. I wouldn't say I'm ugly... I'm really not. Actually from most people I get compliments. ""You are so beautiful"". Or the best friend of my ex said ""everytime you see Toni he's getting hotter"". I started working out, lost some weight and it was good until covid happened and I had to stop. It got me into a spiral again I can't get out. I hate my body again, I gained weight, I hate looking in the mirror in general. I just don't like what I see. Now I wanted to start training again, but of course I fell while biking and now my hand hurts... It's like whenever something seems to get better some higher entity is like ""you thought haha"". What about friends you ask? Never really had them. I met some really cool people when I was with my girlfriend. I thought. When she broke up they all told me ""Toni we want this friendships to last, don't worry"", just to abandon me and never hearing of them again after a few months. Even after I reached out multiple times. And now? Well I wanted to start over again. Moved from my hometown to a new City, got into university. ""New City, New opportunities, New friends"". Well. Covid was like ""nope"" (everything was online), it seems like I'm too dumb for what I'm doing, I'm still only sitting at home, wasted another summer and... I just wonder... Will it ever stop? Will it ever get better? Slowly I'm thinking it will never get better. That every high will just be followed by another down that will tear down everything I've built up so far. ""You got money? Well here's you're washing machine broken! Finally got a person you like? Well they fuck someone else! Finally took the step to a better life? Well I'll do everything that it will be the same in the end! Finally happy with your body and took the step to go to the gym? Well gyms are closed now! Lost 10kg of weight? Well you'll hate yourself either way, don't you? Gyms are open again? Well, fucking fall while biking, hurt your hand and and damage your bike so you can't even bike anymore, because you've got no money to repair it! And let's face it... You need money for a new PC first, because yours is broken and you need one for university, you need new clothes, at least a jacket for when it gets colder!"". I really can't do this anymore. Maybe I'm just whiny... I don't know. But in the end that's just a small insight into my life. I'm 22 now and I'm at that point again I wonder if it even makes sense anymore. Especially when the current state of the world is not getting better either. And the worst thing is... Compared to others, looking at what I've reached yet (at least looking at my apartment). I feel horrible, because I should probably feel good about myself, because I've got it better. I've invested a lot of money into it and I'm really happy with how it turned out. Others would dream of that at that age... Maybe I just can't get enough? I really don't know... Thanks for reading tho. Don't know if anyone got some advice or ideas what I can do. Hope this wasn't too much, but I really have to get this off my chest.",1

"People stressed me by tolding me to stop being stressed, How to deal with stress today? I was easily stressed and angry when I was a kid. Each time it happens my family give me little sentence like Calm yourself. Why are you stressing over X? I'm not stressed for X. why are you angry ? ? Am I angry ? no? so you shouldn't be angry You will have health issues if you continue to be stressed. you will have issue in your work if you are angry. ... They never try to resolve the reason why I was stressed or angry.(that's another issue) Only to ""fix"" the stress in a condescending way. And all their little phrases increased my stress and my anger exponentially. **Today, i'm a 35 adult women.** And fortunately, no one, including those who previously do, don't say this to me anymore . Some of them even admit to me they used those to increase my angry for fun at this time and that they are sorry for that. (I knew that. But it didn't help) The issue is, today, each time I'm stressed, or angry , I still hear those advice in my head. It's still stress me even more, angry-me even more, and can make me cry. That happen, no matter what was the original stress was about. I can cry because my bus is late, because it will trigger some memory like the time I was told I shouldn't be angry for missing a bus because it was my fault of missing the bus. But I can support the pression of talking in front of 400 persons for 1 hour because it won't trigger any old memory. It's also hard to explain to other why I am such a stress mess sometime, but able to support a lot other-time. Consequently some-people think I'm faking my stress. ",1

"For the first time in my veterinary career, a client got me a gift to show gratitude I've been a vet for four and a half years and I specialize in critical care. I run an overnight emergency clinic and mostly see patients who are so ill or injured that it can't wait until the regular clinics open. Naturally it's very high stakes work and we don't save every patient. We also aren't the type of clinic that has a lot of regular clients that we see regularly. People don't bring their cat here for booster shots. They go to regular clinics for that. Yesterday I walk in and find a box of chocolate with a note on it from a recent client thanking me for what I do. I remember her dog. Strongly hypocalcemic seizure patient who did not make it. But despite that the client found it prudent to thank me anyway and that actually made me tear up some. I shared the treats with my staff because it's not just me here and they also deserve it. I just wanted to share because it really did give me a boost. I actually really enjoy what I do and I've worked really hard to get here and it's good to know people actually appreciate it.",0

If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved. Posting this from my second account. This year has been the worst of my (26 F) life. My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful. Edit thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it. Edit 2 Please stop notifying Reddit care services. I’ve received several messages from them. It’s not helpful. You’re not accomplishing what you think you are. Help is something you have to be ready for and I’m not. Please stop notifying them.,1

"My school is letting me register for fall! So I went to a state school for my BA. The tuition isn’t that bad it’s like 6K a year. But I stayed in the student housing and THAT was $21,000 a year. (NYC midtown Manhattan like literally a block away from the Empire State Building. The price was absolutely worth it). But last winter, even though I got A- in ALL my classes they wouldn’t let me register for classes for the spring Bc I owed 16,000 still for the housing. I was in good academic standing so they said I could come back, I just had to pay off the bill first. Fast forward a few months, I moved back home, got a job, and have been paying monthly increments of $1,000, im down to $12,000. A few weeks ago I just went ahead and asked if I could take summer classes, and they let me. (Yay me!) And then today for some reason they told me I’m going to be allowed fo register for classes for the fall. I’m back on track to get my BA in two years rather than three! I’m so happy yall omg",0

"Recent events have killed what little motivation I had. Now I'm just sick due to stress. 15 years ago, my life was miserable. My depression and anxiety were out of control. I was diagnosed with a potentially deadly rare genetic disorder, as well as IBD and Fibromyalgia. I lost so much weight I would cry when I saw myself in a mirror, my mother would cry when she saw me too. And my marriage was falling apart. My wife left my to fend for myself and I lived alone for a year. In that year I built myself back up, got my health issue's (mental and physical) under control, and blossomed. But I was still just existing, not truly living. So I did the most spontaneous thing I've ever done, and moved across country, leaving everyone and everything behind. Moving across country was the best decision I've ever made. I was healthier than I'd been in years, I was enjoying my life, doing things I'd never thought I'd do. In short, I was happy and living my best life. But good things don't last forever. A few years later I moved back because of family issues and some emotional manipulation on their part. I came home to chaos and was instantly thrown back into the hell I had left. But they, my family, got what they wanted so they didn't really care what it cost me emotionally and physically. But, I still had hope I could do or be something more, I still had dreams. But that was 6 years ago. Slowly my dreams dwindled away and my hope was dying, but I still tried to hang on to that, until today. For the last month I've been strapped for money because of some ridiculousness. I've been fighting for weeks to get it back, and finally I got it back today. But there was a problem, because why wouldn't there be. After all that fighting to get my money back, my bank has decided to hold it for 3 to 7 business days. The timing couldn't be more unfortunate. I'm on disability, I get paid one a month, and everything I have goes to paying bills. But because of the issues with my money this month, I haven't been able to pay all my bills. Fortunately I got a small loan to pay my cellphone bill and borrowed money to pay my rent. But what I could not do was pay anything else, and right now that's a huge problem. My niece lives with me and I pay the cable/internet bill. She is doing distance learning and, obviously, need internet access to go to school. Earlier this month I got an extension for the internet service, but now it's due tomorrow. See what I mean about unfortunate timing. But no one will help me and I'm lost. I had to send my niece to my mother's just so she could go to school. But my mother doesn't need the extra hassle, her life is stressful enough as it is. But all of this has taken a toll on me and today has just broken me. Because of the intense stress for the last month, my eczema has flared up on my face, where I've never had it before. My fibromyalgia and IBS have both flared up. I'm just sick to my stomach and I just want to curl up and sleep forever. After all that fighting, my bank is the one that broke me. I can't take anymore stress or I'm going to end up in the hospital. But that looks like what my immediate future is going to be. But, anyway, thanks for letting me vent. I wish I could say I feel better, but I don't. I feel withered up inside and have no more faith or trust in humanity. I know there's a handful of good people out there, but most are not.",1

"Can Anyone Relate? (33M) Hello, I'm new to this Reddit and as of late, my depression is kicking in full throttle.

I haven't really thought about suicide, although I do get thoughts that I might be better off not here. I feel like all I do is let people down and have nothing worth mentioning.

Missing all of my midterms! So at my school we have Monday of regular classes and then tuesday wednesday and thursday are finals. Well i went into a dangerous heart arrhythmia that afternoon and had to go to the hospital where my 17 year old athletic self almost went into cardiac arrest as i went into Vfib. I had a heart ablation the day after and missed all of my tests. If i wouldn’t of gone to the ER that night i would of gone into Vfib while studying and died within minutes(Sudden Cardiac Death). My teachers are all understanding but now i have to go back to school tomorrow and figure out how to fit 6 1-2 hour tests in 55 minute class periods. I don’t want to miss class tomorrow i need one day back to school after missing three weeks due to winter break and recovery. Is there anyone who has missed Midterms or Finals who came up with a good makeup plan. I just need a day or two to go over stuff and have a normal routine as some of my classes changed over the semester.

"I don't know myself outside my mental illness Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant. EDIT God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first. I hope we all recover and start feeling better soon, you all deserve to be okay. Thanks again to everyone.",1
"Is Being Passively Suicidal a Real Thing? I once heard a friend of mine saying that her psychiatrist described her as ""passively suicidal."" Idk if that's a real thing or not, but it really perfectly describes my outlook on life. I'll never have a wife or family, very small social circle, my parents are getting older. Soon enough nearly all of my ties to this world will be gone. I generally enjoy my day-to-day, but I really don't have much of a purpose and to be completely honest don't really have any interest in finding one. If I live to 70, I live to 70. If I die at 40, I die at 40. Hell, if I die tomorrow I die tomorrow. It would be a nice change from trying to live up to people's expectations.",1
"You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself? I don't mean just general regret for your life choices.

"Lost My Job, Feeling Stressed out and Worthless f24 I lost my Job recently due to performance, not wanting to damage relationships I had built in my career I decided to quit instead of be fired and drag it all out. I was a great worker and my colleagues loved me, I just couldn't reach the targets they had set for me. I am currently searching for a new career but I am scared and stressed. I feel like everyone is judging me, I feel like I am not contributing. I don't want to change my personality just because I am jobless. But it seems that people expect me to act a different way (namely more housewife focused things like cooking and cleaning). I want to work on my artwork, but every time I do I feel crushing guilt and stress. I am applying for many jobs a day. I am not expecting anyone will even see this, sorry if this is the wrong sub. I am normally a lurker. ",1
"Very very stupid question] Do you feel better when stressed? Last time I went to the doctor, the doctor said that stress may be the cause of my symptoms. It doesn't feel right. I feel like I'm fairly calm, and when I'm stressed I actually feel better (not perfectly happy, but not depressed). I've been thinking, but aren't the stressful times supposed to be the bad times when you're already stressed?",1
"Sophomore in high school, I don’t care about it anymore and I’m slipping. For some background I’ve always been a good student. Always in mostly honors (in 6th grade I got kicked out of honors math but it was for the best) and teachers usually like me. But this quarter has just left me completely empty of giving a shit about school. I have a job, I’m in band and jazz band, and I I still like those but I hate school now. I’ve never had this much resentment towards it in my life and I just fucking hate it. I don’t know why or how this started but it’s causing me to slip. This quarter just ended and my lowest grades were C+, one in chemistry and one in my honors English class. My dad told me I need to figure out why I got F’s in certain assignments but I just don’t have the heart to tell him I barely worked on them. I don’t feel like I’m lazy because I’m constantly working, but I’m also not putting in the work. I feel so fucking inadequate, I have friends in way tougher classes that are upset that they have an A-. My parents never praise me for good grades, they only ever bring it up when I have less than adequate. What should I do? If I’m not already burnt out I think I might be getting there. ",1

"Having a bit of a spiral right now First time posting here, fairly new to reddit. I've been suffering from depression for years now and have been on many different kinds of medication. Things get bad occasionally and I have a bit of a spiral down. I guess I could feel it coming. I've had issues with work, losing my home (moved in with my bf though so that was a positive but not the way we wanted it because it was a fairly quick decision once I found out I couldn't keep my place anymore after the issues at work), money has been tight the last couple of years but in recent months money has been a massive issue for me, and I've been having some issues with family. I guess things have just been building up a lot. I was managing fine though, trying to keep things together until I made a post this morning on the relationships subreddit asking for advice about this situation with my mum and once comment from someone who had CLEARLY not even read my post was just so hurtful and horrid (even other people said it was unnecessary and they had clearly not even read my post) and it just kind of felt like my brain flipped a switch and I can feel myself just getting worse. I know it was my own fault for posting on reddit because what was I expecting to happen? And now I'm terrified of posting this or looking at my notifications for my other post. I don't know what I expect to get from posting this. Just a rant or something maybe.",1

"What is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention? Last night I was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard. She had been out there by herself for several minutes while I was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldn’t flow through it, the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence (they were within three feet of her, and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit. When I finished getting dinner ready, I happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready. Up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and I never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and I was not expecting anything. After I told her dinner was ready I stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy, mowing she might get in my gfs way. She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened. This isn’t the first time she has snapped at me when I am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things I had listed and believed I had come out to hurry her along to dinner. She is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but I think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she can’t. So I want to know how I can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future. How do I keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary, as I see them, things?",1

The struggles we have faced such as a bad roommate, money, job issues and the feeling of not being comfortable.

"I didn't know I was depressed I have been on lexapro for a week. I know that I'm not seeing the full effects of the drug yet, but I already notice less anxiety and the ability to perform basic tasks without a mental battle. I didn't know I could feel this way. My entire teen and adult life, I have just thought it was normal to struggle to go get the laundry done, to clean the dishes, to take care of myself, to do my job. I didn't understand why other people made it seem so easy, I thought they all had just figured it out or they had been raised with a better work ethic & that I was lazy. I'm not, I suffer from depression and anxiety. I waited until I was 32 to find this out. I waited until I had a major life change, a devastating breakup episode to seek real help other than just counseling. Holy shit what I could have done if I had known sooner.",1

I look like a monster, so I need makeup to leave the house. I give up and slap myself in the face over and over again in the mirror because I deserve it. It's the worst when I smile in the mirror. Seeing my hideous and pathetic smile makes me want to slice my face. I'm worthless. I tried to leave the house but I fucked it up by crying. I shouldn't have tried. I try to cover my hideous face with makeup, a mask, sunglasses, baggy clothes to hide my disgusting body, fasting and fasting and fasting but I'm just getting fatter. Of course I'm alone.

I needed to talk with someone about it, so I called them. The machine picked up and told me to wait and I would be transferred. I waited and some music started playing, then it stopped after 30 or so seconds. Then 30 seconds later it hung up on me. I tried this three times, same thing every time.

"Our conscious awareness is one of our most powerful tool in this life. Being in full control of it opens us up to receive the infinite cosmic energy from the universe. Did he just say infinite? Yes, and you can see how this energy truly is by noticing how every second we get a new opportunity to change our state of being, point of view, and mental state. Child hood traumas, events that happened or even words that were said a long time ago, can hurt and carry through into our adulthood. Robbing us of our aliveness and spontaneity. There is a tendency to store the energy of an unresolved trauma by locking it in the body. Even if the situation happened only once, an unreleased and unresolved trauma can become trapped within the body and its energy field, causing tension, stress and possibly disease Releasing this stored, suppressed or blocked energy is a healthy, natural process that allows a person to resolve issues and to become more alive. One simple method to release this energy is by clearing it from your meridians (channels through which flows energy)((Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force.)) If you are interested into doing this free and simple method here's a [YouTube video]( for you. And here's my Reddit community r/spiritualchills where you can share your own experiences, talk and ask questions about your spiritual energy.",0

"When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do. When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood? When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy. When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do. When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed. When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you. When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down. When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable. When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you. How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time - Edit I was not expecting so many people to see and relate to this post but I guess these feelings are more common than any of us thought. As much as I hate that other people are going through the same thing, reading these replies did make me feel a little more understood and a little less alone so thank you all for that.",1

"my pain (25F) is overwhelming i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain. the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

I’m going apartment hunting this Saturday afternoon and then going on a first date with a guy I’ve liked for a really long time. This Saturday I’m (23 f)going to go with my friend Lindsey to look at apartments. We’re thinking of moving in together and it’s really exciting to be taking that final step out of my parent’s house. I love them both dearly but it’s time for me to start another chapter in my life. Speaking of which I’m also going on my first date with this guy (27 m) I’ve been crushing on for the last year. He’s my friend Angie’s brother and I finally worked up the courage to ask him out Saturday night when we were just hanging out in a group. He seems surprised but genuinely happy and he said yes. We got to spend some time together over the long weekend and had our first kiss Sunday night. We’ve been texting each other throughout the day all week and talking in the phone in the evenings. We both want to try this new taco place that opened up near where I live. So we’re going to go have dinner and maybe a few drinks. I’m really excited about this guy! He’s really quiet but he seems so sweet and I’ve thought he was so good looking from the minute I met him. So right now I’m just in a really happy place and I just wanted to share that!,0
"Does depression make you want to break-up? My (29f) bf (29m) has been going on and off about breaking up with me since the last year. We have been in a eight year long relationship. He was seeking help for depression 3-4 years ago but he never completed treatment, because he started feeling better soon. One year ago, we hit a rough patch, with him doubting things in our relationship and that i did not love him / cheated on him because i was not fully honest with him regarding some things (which I've apologised for, but i never cheated on him) . He quit his job at the same time and started freelancing for a while, only to resume work two months ago in July 2021. Before starting this job, he did seek professional help (not on my insistence, but because he said he needed help with sleep) He was on lexapro and another medicine for 2-3 months before he ghosted his psychiatrist, saying that the doctor was just ripping him off. He has faced major setbacks in his friendships over the last one year, he doubts most of his friends and doubts their intentions, does not feel happy in general. The reason why i think he is depressed is, I cannot recall a time when he was genuinely happy about anything (maybe apart from when he got this new job, but it soon turned into a stressful situation, since this is not full-time employment yet and his performance will be evaluated after he completes 3 months). Earlier, when he would break up with me, he would come back every other week, saying he does love me and cannot live without me and used to apologise for his behaviour. Since the past few months, his stance has become, ""I never loved you, I was wrong to be with you for eight years, I am sorry I didn't say this earlier, even if I did love you, I don't now. You must move on, I will too"". We still meet each other on the weekends, at times, i am helping him out with his grad-school applications (building resume, SOPs, LORs, essays) and we still do talk on a regular basis, it's just that he will be awfully moody one day and then get started with his ""You should move on, I dont love you"" talk. I am trying to understand which part is true, his depression, or his words. I have told him for now, that we are broken up but the conversation on moving on, is something we can have when he is feeling like himself. Our friends also point out his approach of painting everything in black if anything remotely grey is associated with a thing, and they do call him out, at times. But his recent more fierce stance on saying how he does not love me and never did, makes me wonder if i am the one just living in my own thoughts and things weren't what i think they were. We have spent 8 years together and had every intention of building a future together (which even he has talked about, at times, on multiple occasions in the last one year) I am ready to hold on if it's just his depression talking, I have loved him enough to know I can continue for some more time. But I am just not sure if I am right, anymore.",1

"Did this happen to you or is it only me? Hey! I was having a stressful period, and i had a lot of headaches. But while sleeping, one of the weirdest thing happened to me My brain starts shivering, like I was electrocuted. Some weird thoughts starts coming into my head (subconscious thoughts). The most interesting thing is that I was completely conscious of it happening to the point that I feel like I was the reason of it happening in the first place (like i came up with the thoughts). Also, after it finished (it didn't last long like it felt like 20secs) i was completely conscious with my eyes closed, thinking if i think of good thoughts, and regenerate it again, it will have a different feeling. Weird right. But this is not the first time it happened to me. It happened in a same stress period a year ago.

Explained I’ve been walking up at night and stressing at home over work. Thankfully he has understood and I’ve taken a break using the mental health days we get see how I go in a week.,1
"Stressed about MCAT any advice is appreciated Hey so I have always wanted to go into med school and have just recently graduated from my university with a bachelors degree. I am set for med school (hopefully) , but I have to score decent on this MCAT first. I just feel super overwhelmed on where to start and what to focus on. I signed up for Blueprint and they made my free study plan, but I do not want to spend 1,500 just to prepare for this exam. I tried using it in conjunction with Khan Academy, but something about Khan Academy is not helpful, their questions are but not their videos. I was wondering if anyone has some advice for help they could give so I could do well for my MCAT. I plan to take it in January",1
"If my depression spiked during the corona virus is it really depression or is it regular? Before the corona virus came I was suffering from being emotional numb this was because of things outside the virus but would take to long for me to explain however once the corona virus hit my mental health and self care dropped to the floor. For me I was in the 7th grade the first time the corona virus was brought up and we went on lockdown. During does first 6 months as I had my summer break to I played video games constantly with my friends from the uk as that was where I use to live and I was feeling great at the time because any kid at that age would love to not go to school for 6 months, but whilst does months were going by I started realizing how unproductive my daily routine was and how bad my social skills were getting. By this time I was in the 8th grade and now we actually had to do online school. The only thing is me being in my room 24-7 for 6 months straight not doing anything but playing games and eating made my numbness way worse. At this point I started not caring about life anymore and instead of living it would just feel like I’m existing in a dead corpse. It got so bad that I cheated on every online work I got and I did not feel bad at all and I still don’t. Even when I had to go in person to do my final exams I knew i was gonna fail them but still didn’t care. Now I’m a freshman in highschool and I honestly can’t see myself doing anything but working at a fast food restaurant once I finish school. Bring abled to make friends has gotten so as to the point where I find it hard to speak to new people online. To be honest highschool isn’t the worst I’m glad I get to go in person because it’s forcing me to speak to people however I’ve spoke to people about this depression and a lot of people say it is because of COVID however I haven’t seen much people talk about it here. In all honesty I’m hoping that does people are right because I’ve had this numbness for 2 years now and I don’t want it to be something I have to live with forever.",1

"Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'? I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression.",1
"“You’re faking your depression because you look happy” I fucked up. My colleagues/friends at work asked me in which Reddit group I posted the most stuff. And I said in r/depression without thinking. Because my brain is a slow, stupid piece of shit. So they said “Just because you get sad sometimes doesn’t mean you have depression” and “A lot of people are faking depression nowadays” while they both suspiciously looked at me as if I’m some kind of murderer. At work I’m super “bubbly” and “happy” AND IT IS FUCKING EXHAUSTING. After they said all that, I became too awkward to reply. So I walked away, hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again. I just sat on the ground for a bit. Did nothing. Felt like shit but also emotionless. Like I’m floating. Empty, alone and misunderstood. I’m definitely not faking my depression. And it freaking hurts when people don’t believe you because you “seem happy”. I automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though I despise being like that. Faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when I’m finally home I’m just dead in my bed. I’m not positive or bubbly. I’m a negative piece of shit who can’t even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday. +a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on. Yay. Super happy. Ps Sorry, I swear quite a lot when I’m upset. Edit Just wanted to say thank you for all the support, kind comments and my first award c ",1
Everytime i leave my room i am overwhelmed by my family I am 20 and trying to move out when i get the money. I live with my mum and my younger sister who's 16. They dont tidy up after themselves and i consider myself someone who has to have things tidy to feel normal. Its got to the point where every single time i go downstairs its a mess and i either end up shouting and getting angry or crying. I cant cope with having to constantly clean up after them and i know if i just stop itll build up and be messy. Nobody helps me. Just needed to vent because idk what advice to receive.,1
"How do I tell her? I recently told my mum that I'm depressed. While she's very caring, she has not read up on depression and recognises it only as ""the big sad"". To her, there must be a reason to be depressed, much like when people are sad about something. And while I'm sure many of us do, I can't pinpoint a single reason for me feeling this way. She shows plenty concern, but her remarks like ""don't feel sad, okay? I love you, and the whole family loves you"" annoys me slightly. Mainly because she also makes comments like ""you seem perfectly normal to me"". Idk man, I've seen so many people say that shit and when the person finally takes their life, they regret not acting on what the person told them. In any case, could someone advice me on how I should tell her to either educate herself or explain to her that depression doesn't need a reason? I had previously told her upfront that depression is an illness and I don't know why I feel sad. Guess she's not satisfied with that explanation. Then I told her to stop saying such things like I seem perfectly fine, and read up on depression. Guess she hasn't done that either. Advice, anyone?",1
"How to Be Happy (Instead of Miserable) When You Become 60+ Millions of us call happiness their lifelong goal. But few define what happiness means, often leading us to chase what our parents, friends, and role models defined as happiness. So when we are back to wearing diapers, we realize we ignored everything we genuinely esteemed. In my experience studying dozens of happiness frameworks and science-backed studies about happiness, I've found the best chance at being happy at any time comes from defining what happiness isn't. It's like an inverse happiness checklist. In it, you write what doesn't bring you joy and then ensure your current pursuit of happiness, whether it is to travel the world or become wealthy, doesn't include any of the items from the checklist.  The inverse checklist serves two purposes it helps define happiness and tells you which activities to remove from your life. So, for example, if you conclude money doesn't bring joy. But you work from 9-9 because ""hustle is life,"" then reduce the number of, say, side projects you have. Otherwise, you'll be frustrated after reaching financial ""freedom"" and likely feel physically and mentally exhausted. Each person's definition of happiness varies. However, most people can include specific items into their inverse checklist to define happiness. Your definition of happiness cannot reject distress We can't control the decisions and behaviors of humans, animals, or nature. Otherwise, hurricanes and phone thieves wouldn't exist. So no matter the statistical formula you use to predict events or the number of possible scenarios you draw on your whiteboard, potential sources of unhappiness are always around the corner.  To avoid the discomfort from harmful events, some people write a list of sources of distress and eliminate them from their life. For example, they quit their job to run from their nerve-racking boss. Or switch majors. The issue with this list is its potential size—it's infinite because any event in our lives can distress us. A more efficient solution is to invite distress into your life. And realizing happiness can coexist with events that don't match our definition of a perfect activity, day, or life. For example, a harmless event like Microsoft Word crashing before letting you save an article could either ruin your day. Or it could become a fun challenge to overcome. When you welcome distress, you experience two benefits. First, you become used to different causes of discomfort, reducing their chances of affecting you. Second, you realize distress can (and must) coexist with happiness.    Your definition of happiness cannot come from others Most of us chase a definition of happiness that other people set for us, leading to repentance during our deathbed. For example, some people accumulate academic titles to impress their parents, while others seek minimalism according to a monk's advice.  In college, psychologists, doctors, and nurses taught me around 80% of older people under palliative care regretted their lives' choices. But you don't need wrinkles or to be in a hospital to regret your life. So instead, change it today.  First, write down a list of scenarios that would bring happiness to your life. You can then describe the benefits of each scenario and the barriers between you and them. Second, answer the most crucial question ""who's someone in my life who believes this scenario would bring happiness?""  Ask yourself one last question ""Is this goal worth pursuing even though X person shares it?""  Contrast your answer with other items from your checklist. So if you think happiness is living amongst your friends in the countryside (goal), your friends feel the same (influence), but your inverse checklist says you *don't* like being away from the city, then stop pursuing that goal. Avoid being miserable on your deathbed. While your DNA differs from the millions of people who have regretted their life's choices on their deathbeds, you may be following another person's definition of happiness—just like they did. Unfortunately, the old and sick don't have the strength to change their lives drastically. But you do.  So start developing today a definition of happiness your elderly self will accept, one *you* truly believe.  **Share one item you would add to your inverse happiness checklist below.** If you are not comfortable doing it publicly, please DM me on Twitter at @ MrNicolasForero — I'm curious to discover what you would add.",0

"I’m worried I’m losing touch with reality Hi, I’m under a lot of family and social stress, and I’m freaking out because I think I’m starting to lose it. I keep hearing things that I’m not sure are really there, like incoherent whispering, humming, creaking or breathing. I have really vivid, disturbing hallucinations while I’m on the verge of sleep that make me afraid to go to bed at night, the slightest sound panicking me. I’m an excessive daydreamer (not something I want to get rid of) which means I’m constantly in my own head, but it’s becoming harder and harder to control my thoughts. Sometimes I’ll become so entrenched in a mental argument I’ll be motionless for up to half an hour at a time, sometimes to the point of tears. I’ve tried all that ‘mindfulness’ stuff and it doesn’t help me whatsoever, if anything it only stresses me out more. I’m scared to seek help because I don’t want to be seen as “just another attention seeking teenager,” and have already been dismissed by my mother when I shared my concerns. My dad has depression himself and I don’t want to stress him out any more. There’s nobody else I’m particularly close to. At this exact moment I’m the only one still awake at my house and every little sound around me is freaking me out.

"Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding... He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die"" I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back. He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone. I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life. Edit Thank you everyone for the words and suggestions. I have read over each one multiple times. It helps. Sometimes the words from strangers and people traversing through similar waters helps. I will continue to read these. Thank you",1
"Freshman in uni for 2 weeks but I´m already stressed and exhausted I´ve been studying for just 2 weeks in university, but it´s already too much for me. Everytime a lesson starts, we get an assigment. I already have to make 5 assigments and 7 presentations. I have to finish two presentations until Thursday, I have to finish my assigment before Tuesday, and I also have a presentation on Wednesday (my ADHD isn´t really helping me either). And I have to find a free day to go to the doctor´s, because I might have celiac disease. It´s been just two weeks, and it´s already too much. I´m already feeling anxious all the time about the quality of the assigments. I don´t have time to chill out. I constantly feel exhausted, my back hurts, and I´m irritated and agressive all the time. I´ve already gave up on all of my hobbies. I barely talk to anyone. I sleep for 4 or 5 hours, because I have so much homework to do. My mom keeps threatening me with kicking me out if I don´t meet her expectations. She keeps demanding more and more from me, but I just can´t keep up with her requirements. She also keeps making threats to throw out my headphones whenever I wear them outside. And she keeps trying to read all my messages and she wants to know about everything I do. When I asked her why, she just said that it´s for my own sake. She is so controlling that everytime she hears me type on a keyboard, she comes to my room to check if I´m writing an assigment. And if I´m not, she hits me, screams at me and tells me to get to it, and that she wants me to have more pages written than what professors required. She keeps telling me to find a job, which I want to do, only if I had more time. And now, on top of my father´s alimonies, she now requires monthly payments of half of what he sends in monthly, and she is expecting me to pay for internet and TV. My girlfriend thinks that it´s funny and cute when I´m angry or frustrated, so she keeps trying to make me even angrier by any means. When I asked her if she even cares about how I feel, she just laughed and said that ""Yeah, I care about you, but it´s funny to watch you get angry."". We are in a long distance relationship, and when I try to call her in the evenings to talk about stuff, she just says that she is out with friends or that she is too tired to talk to me, even when she promises me to talk to me the day before. I straight up told her ""We should break up if all I´m good for is the amusement you get out of my struggles."", and she just said ""Nah, I like watching you get mad for no reason."". She´s really pushing our relationship to the edge of breakup, but I don´t want to stay alone, because frankly, I have no friends left, and she is my last person left that I can even remotely consider a friend. I nearly busted into tears in front of a crowd of people today. I can barely hold it all back. Even my new classmates keep wondering about why am I so down all the time, because for them, it´s a walk in the park. Yeah, for me it´s a walk in a park as well, but the park is on fucking fire, because it´s a park near Satan´s flaming balls. Everybody wants too much from me, and I can´t carry that burden. I want to find a way out, but I don´t know what to do.",1

"I don't know how to get help From mobile. Please forgive any errors. I have been suffering slight depression for years now. Mostly loneliness and I suppose from the general sense of responsibility. I am the sole breadwinner for my parents. Im doing OK but it always feels like it will never stop. I see no plausible way how my life can get better. I don't want to go deep into all my issues. But thr gist is I'm doing my job but I am not happy. I feel guilty when I feel sad because I have so many good things in my life. I feel like I should not be complaining. I want to happy. But I don't know how to be. I wish I could. Whenever I think about it, I feel like the only way I can be at peace is if the whole world just ends. I know it's a horrible thing to say. I'm not suicidal because that will not solve anything for me. I want to take care of my parents. Im no use to them if I'm dead. I tried getting help with a mental health professional to better cope with whatever I'm going thru. But she rated me as a moderately severe depressed person and said she would send me details to a therapy group. But she never did. Just forgot. It just feels like everyone has abandoned me to deal with my problems. I want to be able to handle my troubles better myself. But it would be so nice to have someone who is willing to help. To care. I don't know what to do to get rid of this feeling that I will never be happy. And the only consolation is that the world may end someday and I don't have to deal with it anymore.",1

I then mentioned how lately in this series, a character's skull has become cracked (it showed an x-ray type of shot of it and everything.) And I asked if milk would be enough to heal this character's cracked skull this time. And someone responded to me with ""Oh, so you're a shit poster then. Or just stupid.""

"So many people have told me that they care and that I need to keep them in my life I live across the ocean from my home country and it's very isolating. I always felt so alone. Recently I have come to my country and visiting aunts, cousins, siblings that I have no contact with and they all tell me to not exclude myself. Even cousins that I haven't had much contact in my life have told me that they want to know how I'm doing and so and so. I never knew they cared about me like this. Im going through a break up from an abusive relationship and hearing about how they value me as a person makes me happy. I dont know how to explain but it really gives me comfort. I have been so down before that I had to be hospitalized for a week and I felt that no one cared, but I know that it's not the truth. Family is the most important to me and I feel glad that these people want to be apart of my life. The support I am receiving and people that are listening to me and understanding my side and telling me that they want the best for me, that they know I deserve better is overwhelming great.

"Mini-burnouts Hi, I'm dealing with a hard-to-grasp psychological problem. The pattern is somewhat like this I'm always highly stimulated. Sometimes I'm tempted to work too hard, and end up in some sort of mini-burnout. This happens about once a week, and leaves me foggy and unmotivated (dopamine-depleted?) for about 2 days. I have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this. When I'm overly excited, it inhibits me (probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited), but I don't feel any anxiety. I'm often hardly aware of how stimulated I am. Sometimes, I am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode, work my ass off, try to complete my whole to-do list in one day.This pretty much instantly triggers a mini-burnout. This also happens when I drink just one cup of coffee. Except when I'm socially active then I can take all the stimulants I want and be fine. Weird. This state has gone on for about 2 years, and I still haven't been able to make sense of it. Maybe there's a blindspot somewhere. Anyway, other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me, I have a question about a specific solution I have in mind. My defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down, through reframing my situation as easy, meditating, ignoring my to-do list, etc. Now I have a suspicion that this mini-burnout is emotional or motivational in nature. That I'm not actually chemically depleted, but that there's a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that I go down. Or alternatively that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach. It would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions. Reframing my high stress as excitement, instead of anxiety. Maybe that will make the stress less chronic. But I'm afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place, because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal, thereby increasing it. And that would be extremely high-cost, for I've been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout. Could anyone shine their light on this? Any progress on this problem would be major for me. Thank you.",1
"When I get stressed out I feel like I’m hearing voices yelling in my head When I get overwhelmed and anxious I feel like there are a million thoughts in my head that I can’t control. It feels like yelling and even sounds I can’t explain. There is pressure around my ears and kind of a ringing sound, and I get a feeling at the bottom of my back. My brain feels all jumbled like someone is stirring it. I’ll be studying and it’s so hard to focus on school when this happens.",1
"Can't stop thinking of my parents getting older I live a decent distance from my parents. I have a good relationship with them and all, but I don't feel like we're close or have much of anything in common. I get anxious when I think of calling them because I don't know what to say. I work in IT for a living and at this point all I do is pretty much work, and my parents are the furthest bit from understanding what I do, so we have nothing to talk about except the past. I'm in my mid-20's but my Dad is pushing 60 and moms on her way too. Both are in okay shape but I know that it's going to come one day.... I toss in bed thinking of them getting older and knowing one day that they'll be gone. I don't know how to connect to them let alone anyone except my wife nowadays and branching outside of that social circle gets me anxious. Anyone else have the same issues?",1
I wish I could give my life to someone who actually wants to live Fuck New Years by the way,1
I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living. It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there? Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them? Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from? How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die.,1

"How to calm the body down? Does anyone find their body flares up in a stress response at any kind of deviation from equilibrium?

I just don’t know how to calm it down. I do yoga, I journal, I nap if I feel I need to, I try to say no to social events I don’t really want to go to, I take Xanax as and when I need - I mostly just ride it out and try and take care of myself but sometimes these symptoms get in the way of things I need to do!

"Stressed, but for no reason? Hi there! I was wondering if anyone may have some wise words, or advice on how I could possibly manage chronic stress, when I have it for no reason! I seem to have all the symptoms; I can't sleep more than 5 hours a night, and wake up constantly, I have a ""stress belly"", I feel anxious often, and I am forgetful. I feel I am also exhausted when it comes to relationships, zero sex drive and often feel anxious. However... I can't understand why? I am pretty lucky in my life, and have a roof over my head, good friends and food in my fridge. I exercise a moderate amount, eat a healthy diet with lots of fruit and veggies, and I am pretty good at getting a work-life balance (I think!). I have hobbies I enjoy, and spend time socialising, and I am not really stressed out with university or work. However I just feel like there is a constant stress in my stomach. So does anyone have any idea of where I am going wrong... or if there is anything I can do? I really want to feel less anxious and tired! Thank you anyone who reads this!",1
"I have a friend who is talking about self harm, I need to know what to do to help them. Hey Reddit I was told here would be a good place to post this, as I said in the title I have this friend who is talking about self harm and I don’t know what to do. He told me yesterday that “I honestly dont know what im doing but i might not see you tommorow - or the day after that- or ever but if i do anything drastic (dont know if i will) just know its better for the world and the people around me” this was the only mention of suicide that he has told me directly but he has also made a lot of self harm jokes and vented about how much of a failure and disappointment he thinks he is. He says he hasn’t eaten or slept in four days I don’t know how I can help them. I just can’t handle both my emotions and trying to help him work through his Some added info He’s a trans man (hasn’t come out yet) in a family that is very likely not to accept him. He also told me (a trans girl) he loved me and I told him I only liked him as a friend, I know if I told them I loved them then that would probably help them but I don’t want to lie, he hasn’t mentioned anything about him harming himself because I only like him so I don’t think he’s manipulating me as one person suggested. We are both still living with our families and so trying to get someone like a therapist is a bit harder.

"depression+shitty uncontrollable life circumstances hi. 22 yr old diagnosed at 17. we all know that depression is bad enough, chemical imbalance and all…but couple that with some genuinely shit circumstances (auto immune disease, medical debt, car accident, 5th year senior due to medical issues, no support system, poverty) and it’s like fighting an uphill battle with no relief. i’ve been trying to be positive, to “manifest” and work hard. i’ve tried to be strong, to think of better days, be grateful for what little i have. it’s just…i can’t believe how “unlucky” i am. sometimes all i can do is laugh, really. life is just so exhausting. i feel like i’m completely defined by my shortcomings, and no matter how hard i try to overcome these challenges, i just get dragged down even lower than before. i’m not a religious person, but i know at this point, i need a fucking miracle or my misery will kill me before i even hit my mid 20s.",1
"I've tried but I don't know what else to do Sorry for the new throwaway account but I don't want any of my family or friends to know this is me Background info I'm a 16 year old female, school for me starts in about 2 weeks (a little less) TW for mentions of suicide - Okay so... I've tried. I've really tried. For years,actually, for most of my life, I've been suicidal. I've always found something to blame my emotions on but at this point I think I'm just depressed. For the majority of the time I've kept it to myself. Only ever told a couple very close friends, but never my family directly. But recently I decided to tell them... most things. Not everything, but a lot. Because ""I can go to them with anything"" right? Well I told them I was stressed out about school and that I don't think stressing out over tests is worth it right now. I said that school should come second, mental health first. They freaked out about this. Basically told me I'm lazy and need to focus on school cause ""that's my job."" They made me feel like it was ""wrong"" to ever say or think such a thing. I told them that I was stressed out about my future and feel like I need to do more towards my career. They basically said that's not important right now, worry about it later or ""on the side."" I even said that I'm suicidal. And when I said that I thought they might calm down and realize I actually have a problem, I'm not okay. But my Dad just yelled at me and my Mom didn't say a thing. I felt no concern or anything. Just anger. I don't feel like ever opening up to them again. I don't understand how they don't see this is a cry for help. Even other things, like how I've been sleeping more lately. My grades dropped near the end of last year. I've lost interest in hobbies. Seems like a ton of signs but they just get mad and act like I basically need to figure it out and stop being ""lazy."" Essentially ""just do it."" - I honestly don't know what to do so I'm coming here for advice. Might post this in a couple places, I don't know. What do I do at this point?",1
can’t hide it in public anymore i can’t hide how depressed and dead inside anymore. my eyes look dead even when i’m wearing a mask it’s visible how miserable i’ve become. people laugh and make jokes and i can’t even pretend to react it’s too hard and unnatural now. i feel extremely drained after a full day of being around new people and i wish i could go play cards with the other freshmen but i know i couldn’t possibly force myself to look like i’m having any fun. i wish i could be an extrovert and get comfortable around people very quickly. i’m going to look into anti depressants.,1

All I can do I sighing all through the day and feeling nothing. I badly want to relapse. I badly want to see blood gushing out of my body but there's something unknown which makes me exhausted. I can't help myself to drive that away. Right now I'm feeling so agitated because I wanna cry but I'm not being able to do it. I wanna scream but words aren't coming out of my mouth. I feel like I'm dumb, I'm deaf. Why can't I be myself again?what's so wrong with me? My hobbies and passion are eventually fading away from my mind. I can't write stories or compose poetries anymore. I don't feel like doing anything except for self-damaging things. I go for running but the main intention behind that is making myself more exhausted and bringing pain.

I sometimes cry out of frustration because i can't do my school work. Everyday is like the same routine nothing changes. Constant reminder of wanting to die. I honestly think i'm pathetic.

"Death anxiety sucks. About a year ago I started to get anxiety about death. It never really bothered me before that. It’s not dead people, or what it must feel like to be dead. I love Halloween, graveyards, the ghost stories. And I do not believe the dead know that they’re dead. It‘s the process of dying that gets me. I think about people who were murdered, and how bleak and awful that must be. For your last moments to be filled with fear as someone completely behind reason causes you mortal pain and injury. For your final experience to be the not only the worst, but the loneliest. It must be like the worst panic attack you’ve ever had, times a thousand.

"When does stress become a “disability” or can it? Help/Advice welcome Hi there, I am brand new to this sub. I honestly searched Reddit for a stress sub bc I don’t know who else to ask (short of going to my doctor - which I’m not sure is warranted). I have been out of work throughout the pandemic and while it carried its own type of stressors I noticed after awhile that I had little to no heat burn, rarely experienced migraines anymore, and even my asthma seemed to subside. I have surmised that they were all in someway triggered by stress/anxiety. Of course I have been searching for a new job but out of fear from the pandemic I wasn’t in desperation mode. Now over a year out it just seems like time and I’ve been more heartily searching. I have multiple interviews coming up and while I haven’t consciously stressed over it, but I have noticed that I have been experiencing indigestion and last night I had the worst migraine of my life. Pandemic aside, I have enjoyed my free time over this last year and after last night I’m afraid to go back to that level of stress. Anyone have any suggestions? Should I talk to my doctor? It’s all kind of circumstantial. I’m single so I need some kind of income but I don’t want it to come at my health’s expense.",1
"Darkest before the dawn, right? Struggling with stress for 2 months now. Coaching sessions only focus on the thoughts and how to take control of my wandering mind and all the overwhelming thoughts that keep piling up. But what I'm now facing is a whole different kind of monster... The physical reactions and symptoms now with dizziness, constant headache from tension in neck and shoulders and the dark and gloomy thoughts of all the possible complications and deceases that may follow a period of stress illness. My mood is around 0 and all my thoughts are on the above. When I force myself to do other stuff, like briefly play with my kids or focus on a cup of coffee, I feel a bit more relaxed. But as soon as my mind is not actively focused on something else, I slip back into darkness.

No one cared when I attempted suicide Back in February of 2019 I attempted suicide after a painful heartbreak and a series of friendships ending. I reached out to people while I was recovering in hospital but no one responded. In the 3 weeks I was in hospital my mum was the only person that came to visit me.

I went through emotional, mental, and sexual abuse as a child and was in therapy from ages 11-18 because of it. Things got better for a bit, and then got worse. I’ve been addicted to countless forms of SH over the years; substances, self mutilation, eating disorders, etc. Things finally started looking up for me when I went to treatment for my ED last year but then I developed multiple chronic illnesses and had to stop going as I now exist in a perpetual state of stomach pain, nausea, exhaustion, nerve pain, etc. My college plans were thrown for a loop because of my current health state and I have surgery in November that have a high chance of making things worse. I hate myself, and always have. I literally want to throw up looking at myself in the mirror and I’ve pushed away everyone I’ve ever cared about. I know I’ll never get to live a normal life.

"Not Sure What To Do So a little background. First, this isn't my main Reddit account and the name is coincidental... but accurate. Second, I've suffered from pretty extreme anxiety for pretty much my whole life, but it's only really been the last 2-3 years I've suffered from the kind of symptoms you would generally associate with bad depression. And the last week has sent me over the edge in both regards. I'm falling behind in college even though it's a subject I should, and do, love. I feel my a few of my teachers are complete assholes, and events in my life during the last week have really put me down. Between all that, I'm honestly having a panic attack right now about class this morning. To be honest, the events of the last week turned my depression into the realm of suicide ideation. I hate to say that, but I have thought about it. I had to take my father to the hospital, and I didn't know if he was going to come back. And then my mother found stuff which didn't paint him in a great light. I've felt like complete crap ever since. I'm calling a doctor today after class today, and I'm going to get help. I don't want to live like this, and I can't. I can't keep feeling the way I do, because I know it is a path to self-destruction, and I don't know if it's me specifically or the rest of the world or a combination. All I know is I need help, I can't do it myself. I hate asking for help but I need it. I dunno. I'm not sure what to do. I don't have anyone to turn to or talk to.

They are offering a free summer camp just for the smart kids AND providing transporation!! I really love the transportation factor because I just got a new job and i have no way of picking her up on time, thankfully... they have a special bus just for the kids that will pick them up and take her home. The bus stop is within few of my doorstep so I dont have to worry about her walking home alone either. Its really like God answered my prayers this year. I stress about summer almost all year and it was great to get a letter that she had been chosen for this special program.

"Could my depression be lack of food+nutrition? Hi all, so I’m a depressed individual who is unmedicated. I have taken another turn for the worst and wanted to share some observations. I have always been a very skinny dude. I wake up, drink coffee, and don’t eat for at least 2 hours. My job is very physically demanding. I do manage to eat 3 meals a day, but are small portions, maybe 1 piece of fruit and rarely vegetables. I’m nearly 6 feet at 150 pounds, over the last 6 months I’ve maintained 142 pounds and my depression has worsened. (Extreme negative thoughts, hopelessness, thoughts of suicide, afraid to go to store/errands, lack of self worth).. I’m come to realize my depression may be linked to a low serotonin issue. I found this out because I’ve taken molly, mushrooms, and I feel fantastic on these substances. I also feel really good after exercise. All serotonin increasing things. What my life has always lacked is a balanced diet. I eat because I have to, not because I really enjoy it. And I notice that with everyone around me. I did some research that 70-80% of serotonin is produced in the gut. And if I’m constantly not getting enough serotonin producing foods, I might be screwing myself from the get go. I drink casually, once during the week and once on weekend, few drinks at a time. I’m a carpenter so I get enough exercise. I have friends I see often, a good family, a good job.

"My family searched my room while I was in the hospital I don’t know if anyone will even read this, I just need to tell someone what is happening. here’s the story a little over a week ago I admitted my self into the hospital because I did not feel I could keep my self safe any longer. The next day brother was “looking for cough drops” at least that the excuse they used. And he looked in the box where I keep all of my SH tools in. He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. ",1

20y male stressed out about feeling stuck Moved down to my parents place after some stuff went down with my aunt. Now not making as many hours and still no one is teaching me to drive. I’m stuck in Georgia not able to do anything bc I’m not making enough money and I can’t drive so my options are very limited. Used to making 350 usually with my aunt now only making around 120 or 160 at Kroger and my stress is through the roof messing with my social life and my mental health in general. Really relying on the second stimulus check to hopefully make it through the year.,1

"Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares... I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don’t understand. There are days that I’m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don’t want to live like this. I’m done. I apologize for doing this here. I have nowhere else to do this.

"Where does stress come from? It is perhaps an accepted fact that stress is usually brought on by outside forces.  This is so ingrained in most people’s mindsets, that the slightest inconvenience or signs of being pushed out of the comfort zones will get some negative reactions from the body, and that would be considered stress. Generally outside forces are blamed for the internal turmoil that stress is supposed to cause.   Where Is It When life in general does not unfold the way we perceive it should, determines the stress levels we experience.

"My (27M) dad (58M) killed himself and it's my fault My dad lived far away and I lived independently after a lot of quarrel with my relatives whom I stayed with for a while (long story, deserves its own post). Despite effectively being banished from the rest of the family, I was still in good terms with my dad. One day he asked for money, said it was to start a business there and that I'd get a share of the income. I was struggling with my own career and even financially but I found my way to send the amount he requested anyway. I was even jobless (too ashamed to admit it) when I sent the money. A month passed, and there was no update on the business. I followed up and he said he was busy, there was some delay, etc. Even more months passed and there was barely anything. I chatted/texted him and he said he'll just return the money when he can. Turns out that he was financially struggling there as well. I was able to find employment eventually but I was paranoid. I don't have any savings on my own nor any emergency money. My sick leaves are unpaid and I will not have income if I'm sick with covid. I kept asking him if he could send even a fraction of that amount. I told him that I can't even find work-from-home setups as I can't afford the equipment needed. He said he still couldn't send any amount at all. I was mad. I told him of all the times he told me I should've forgiven the family, obey them blindly, and so on. And here we are now in a situation where they're not even helping him. I urged him to just borrow from them. They're well off, I'm not. I'm surviving by own monthly income with barely any savings. Plus I had to borrow a bit of money to send him which I still have to pay off. He kept apologizing. Said he's trying to find a way. I was losing my patience. I kept following-up every week or so. Sometimes months. I was also pissed because family already banished me and I feel like I'm being forced to join this problem. I had no reason to mistrust my dad and I'm sure he genuinely needed help. But the clan could help him better than I could. One day he texted saying he can pay me back soon. The next day I learned that he killed himself. I didn't want this to happen... I know more context or info is needed so I'll edit and comment along the way. I'm still shaken by this.",1
"As my depression lifted, the world seem to change around me I have a story that I’d like to share. I think it pretty accurately reflects how depression shaded my world, and how that changed once I started to get better. I’ve been lurking here a while, and want to let people know that things can get better. I had been in a rut for several years. It got to the point where I could barely get out of bed. I don’t know exactly what changed, but I decided that I had had enough, and would do what I could to get better. For me, this took the form of quitting smoking (I was up to a pack a day), and going out for jogs. I was in university at the time. There was a lagoon on campus, a small lake that was next to the ocean, about 1.5 miles around. I decided this would be a good place to try running laps. I was AWFUL. Out of shape, could barely breathe, and was only able to run for a few minutes at a time without my lungs and legs screaming to stop. I was certain I must have looked awful and that everybody was judging me. But I kept at it. I noticed this woman out there, walking laps. She was an old woman, with nasty hair, sagging skin, and she wore these horrible flip-flops, which revealed toe nails that definitely needed clipping. “What a hag”, I would think to myself. “Why is she even out here?” As I started going out there regularly, I saw her almost every day. Eventually, I started to wave to her as I would pass. The first few times, she didn’t notice. But eventually, she would wave back. Then, I started smiling and waving, and she would smile and wave back. It became a part of my routine to wave and smile at her while out on my runs. She was working almost just as hard as I was, getting out there every day. I was getting close to graduation, and this would be my last run around that lagoon. So when I saw her that day, I stopped and started to talk to her. We introduced ourselves. She told me that she had lost her husband a few months prior to a heart attack, and that she was hoping to get into shape so that she could get healthier and live long enough to see her grandchildren grow up. This interaction brought me to the brink of tears. The woman looked nothing like when I first saw her. She was smiling, had a glow of positivity about her, and even got herself some proper footwear! As I got better, the way I saw and interacted with the world also got better. I imagine that this woman’s view of me as an overweight slob who could barely breathe trying to run might have improved as she got better too. You are not alone. Things can get better.",1

"Nobody has ever shown romantic interest in me Context I am a 20 year old college student with severe clinical depression and anxiety. I have a decent amount of friends and we pretty regularly hang out and go out together. My friends say I’m not an unlikable person, I have some hobbies including reading and writing, I’m told I’m pretty funny and as far as I know my friends and family like having me around, however I tend to be more on the introverted side and don't always take to people right away. I also don’t think I’m necessarily ugly, just not attractive. I have a skinny build, I'm 5'10"", etc. etc. I've gone through two whole decades of my life and not a single person has ever shown a romantic interest in me. I have had and currently have plenty of friends who are girls and have never had an issue talking with them, so it's not like I am someone who never puts themselves out there. During quarantine, a bunch of friends and I downloaded Tinder as a way to talk to people around campus while we stayed shut in our apartments/homes. Nothing really came of it, but I quickly realized that I wasn't having the same experience as all my other friends. They were getting tons of matches and likes, and I was only getting a few likes/matches. All the conversations I had with matches never seemed to go anywhere, despite trying different approaches and even having my friends give me advice. When I brought up my lack of likes/matches to my friends, they tried ""overhauling"" my profile to be more like theirs, but there was no change. Tonight a couple friends and I were hanging out and they were all swiping through Tinder (and getting matches) while discussing their plans with some of these girls to hookup/hangout. Obviously I had nothing to contribute to the conversation and just sat there, scrolling through Tinder while watching my friend next to me get 3 matches in a row. I felt awful. I'm just so tired of it all. I wasn't worried in high school about girls/relationships as I figured I'd have plenty of chances in college to pursue those things, but I'm coming to realize that people are just not interested in me. I feel like I've tried everything, and seeing my friends put no effort into any of it and still have so many girls coming to them makes me feel like just giving up. I'm scared because I feel that after I graduate, it's only going to be that much harder to meet people. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone is/has been in the same boat and if anyone has any advice.",1
"Asian parents is guilt tripping me on paying their rent. 18yo in need of guidance Hi I live in Malaysia, I'm 18yo going to be 19yo this coming November. I have two sister, one is 20yo another is 22yo. I have just graduated from high school and my mother is asking me to help pay for rent, I don't have any skill I have only just started learning to code whereas both my sister had a few year break and is playing games 24/7 even right now they are playing. Although one is studying biomedical whenever she have free time is just games. My parents doesn't have much money left and we r just barely getting by but my parents continue to buy useless/ unnecessary snack, coffee etc. Also my mother likes to waste water by cleaning the floor multiple times with just only water (OCD) not soap even when I have already clean it. I have also already told them many many times (throughout 11 - 18yo) to not buy any more snack, and have told my mother that washing with water does not really clean the area and also told my sister to help out with the chores at least. But my effort is all for nothing, I have only added extra stress in my life. Is it wrong to think that this is unfair or am I being in the wrong here? Because when I'm telling my sister to learn some skill instead of playing games they get defensive and started to argue with me. I didn't force them to learn I'm just telling them that they should learn something instead of playing games whole day My parents father 60+yo, mother 50+yo both have not work for a really long time. I won't and can't tell them to work because they r my parents, and I'm still living under their roof I have already gave up telling them what to do, because of this I have learned that you can't actually tell people what to do if they not willing to listen, and change. I'm In constant stress, my parents doesn't allow me to work because of Covid. So instead while I still have roof under my head I'm doing everything I can to learn the necessary coding skill / graphic design so I can start working. When I was younger I told my mother I will help with the rent but that was a year ago I didn't really think that through, my mistake on my part. Now my mother is guilt tripping me to pay for the rent. I'm using my allowance and am also out of cash ( shouldn't even be called allowance since I'm technically returning the money ) Because of this stress, I'm also constantly thinking why do so many people have a child when they are not financially stable or mentally prepared to be a parent. What do people expect when they have a child? Isn't it just a cycle, baby, adolescent, teenager > go college, young adult > start working, old adult > retired and have a child. Then cycle repeats again and again. In my case my parent want me to continue the family name. What would your advice be? Am I being a spoiled child? Note My parents is loving but to me they r not ready to be a parent. ( They always argue, talk about money in front of me and my sister, not telling my sister to do any chore. Etc ). I don't have any driving license and my parents are also quite strict I quite embarrassed to say this but I cant ride on a public bus without their permission first. I had my Covid shot but parent still won't let me work outside.My sister is not helping to pay rent, I can't tell them what to do because they will go defensive and we will be in an argument again Don't have to sugar coat your answer, I'm also writing here so that I can improve on myself.

"Help me with what? New throwaway I guess Some background I'm a young adult, have had lifelong diagnosed depression along with diagnosed anxiety and two past psychotic episodes one being due to unspecified worsening depression and one being ER psychosis. No legitimate suicide attempts, only recurrent 'SI'. I don't even really know what to say except my life is beautiful and I'm so ugly. Can't even laugh without smoking weed these days and now that I haven't been able to smoke for a week or so due to pending responsibility I'm feeling peculiarly dead inside. All I feel on the daily basis is pain from chemo meds, anger from nowhere, and the familiar lukewarm void that is walking depression. My sleep and mental health have been in a downward spiral due to an overnight trip I took recently and it's causing my chronic pain to flare up. Over this summer I've degenerated into a slow and unintelligent version of myself. I've been so angry about, well, everything. I get angry at any videogame with the slightest hint of a competitive aspect, I get angry at the love of my life over trivial things, and I get angry at myself for being useless, depressed, and unemployed for several months now. When I'm not angry I become lachrymose and apathetic while the icy waves of nothing numb me to the bone and the prickly sand turns my flesh to ash. Today I had what is usually a great day, I spent time with my boyfriend. Normally cuddling, gaming, and watching the television turn my worst days to gold, however, I felt nothing; the few good moments he wrenched out of my corpse were quickly consumed up by the little black hole inside my brain's labyrinth. Today my soul became an arid desert drought of tears. God what I would not give to cry, I'd rather cry than cum or savor soft warm food. When he dropped me off at my house I didn't know what to feel, if anything at all came. I ambled toward my parent's house and calmly watched a frog from the nearby lake jumping across our driveway as herds of others do in this season. The nothing I felt twisted into anger over half-hearted drama from a message thread with some now ex-friends. I kicked the frog with quite a substantial portion of my bleak energy, I stepped on it and kicked it into the wall of the house. I just craved any kind of emotion which I so thirstily received. I felt a tiny spark of guilt because I normally adore small insects and animals, I almost even shed a tear, however, the nothing arrived shortly after. So now I lie in my bed at the bottom of my own personal ocean typing a post to strangers, for what? I don't know what's wrong with me. I need help but nobody on the internet is going to fix me and make it all go away. I don't even know what the point of typing this was other than some stupid new level of attention-seeking. Well fuck it all and have a goodnight if you read this far.",1

"Anxiety; depression; ptsd from childhood trauma 30 years later? Any insight appreciated. *Backstory** I'd like to tell my story in hopes someone can offer some insight about where to go from here or assurance that I'm not alone. The pandemic hasn't treated any of us well, myself included. I had two non-life-altering events occur about 10 and 7 months back that spun me out with some disproportionately intense anxiety and I started questioning a lot of stuff about my behavior, sanity and even intellectual capability. For years I'd been having intrusive thoughts I kept dismissing as just a bad habit or related to stress. They're mostly self-critical, sometimes slightly paranoid in content. As the pandemic fell upon us these thoughts got WAY intense. I was shushing myself out loud in front of people sometimes because I couldn't think or listen to the radio or anything without them inundating my mind. They've since calmed down a little over the summer, and I'm pretty scared of going back there. I didn't even know they were intrusive thoughts until maybe a month ago. I really thought I might have a mental illness or intellectual disability. I'm still very confused about how I feel. Since I got my vaccine, I've felt comfortable going to the Dr.'s office and brought up what I thought was ""anxiety"". I had a blood test (results fine) and after some screening questions my Dr. asked me if I was depressed. I didn't think so at the time, but my symptoms (primarily early morning awakenings, rumination, the thoughts, and not sadness but a discomfort I can't describe) more closely match depression than anxiety, so I've been given a script for some antidepressants. I don't know that I'm ringing all the bells for depression or anxiety though. **Here's where I need some insight.** I am extraordinarily uncomfortable discussing with my Dr. how I feel. My voice is shaky and I feel like I'm fighting back tears with a queasy feeling in my chest. I was asked at one point if I experienced childhood trauma. While I hadn't considered my childhood traumatic before, I knew it wasn't ideal. Now I'm looking into childhood trauma, and I'm hitting many points on the list I'd been threatened with abandonment, lived a parent who abused alcohol, witnessed domestic violence, and it was frequently a hostile environment (yelling, slamming cabinets and doors and such). Having a child of my own now, I'm questioning other aspects of my upbringing. I'm a grown man, and I've lived with this for 30 years. I feel fucked up that I'm this terrified of how I feel, my intrusive thoughts, and how emotionally volatile it feels to discuss my feelings with a Dr.. I can maybe see how some of my experiences in childhood are effecting my adult behavior. I don't know if pushing it all down again and moving on is a solution. Is this discomfort something that can be corrected? Why is this happening now; the stress of the pandemic; I can't be the only person in their late 30's going bananas and wondering from where this came from, right? I've started getting help -- I'll try the antidepressants and see if I can stabilize -- but where do I go from here? If you made it here, thanks for your time.",1

"Stress is the silent killer. Mental and emotional stress affects every cell in the body. The mind can turn the body's pH from acidic to alkaline in a matter of minutes. Stress can adversely affect the genetic makeup in your body; the mind can positively or negatively affect DNA. One of the fastest and easiest to feel, method to counteract stress, comes from a natural reaction that our physical body has to us having consistent/strong enough positive thoughts. Whether from positive memories, thanking God, thinking about your future plans, someone you love, inspiring or moving moments in life/movies/songs. Really consider the fact that from just thinking certain positive thoughts your whole physical body can get chills all over it or just in certain locations (for now). If you take time to notice you will find that your self induced positive chills have an accompanying sort of wave underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot). After researching what that specific current underneath the skin is I came across a sort of *energy* we have that is tied to our spirit. I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Goosebumps, The Force and many more. Now consider this if you can truly induce that feel good occurence at will, you can definitely use it to counteract feelings of stress. If you would like to know how to take control of that energy and how to, at will, stop that paralyzing feeling of stress on it's track. Here's a five minute [YouTube video]( for you.",1
"I finally got away from my toxic mother and I regret it It's only for 2 years (for now) because I had to move away for school and I just regret it. I miss my dad, who I had to leave behind with my mum, I have two roommates I can't seem to get along with, school is hell because I can barely pay attention and have no motivation, it's almost impossible to take care of myself and I'm barely able to deal with all my other responsibilities. If that wasn't enough, I have to deal with my depression and anxiety and it's getting worse by the day. At least that's what it feels like. I can't even get along with others because my social anxiety is so bad, I immediately start to panic as soon as someone tries to talk to me. I also feel like there's nothing to say about me because depression just made me become a zombie. This is hell. I already had little to no will to live when I was home and now it only got worse. I guess life isn't for everyone. I'm really starting to believe, that I wasn't meant to get this far and now everything is trying to get rid of me.",1

Your supposed to trust the passive social cues, but my mind isn't well suited for that, as I have psychosis symptoms so I try to practice ignoring things.

"Exercise for PPD after a c-section that isn't walking? I have had depression throughout my adult life. I had a baby about 1 week ago and was preemptively diagnosed with PPD during my pregnancy given my mental health history and a fairly rough go of it during pregnancy. I am not sure what to do. I've tried various SSRI/SNRI's but the main side effect for me is excessive drowsiness, obviously not doable right now with a newborn and very little sleep. I'm in therapy, but I've been bouncing around different therapists for the last 6 years and no one has really helped me at all. I think I am in the small subset of people for whom therapy just isn't a good treatment option. Exercise has been the most helpful for me in the past in managing depression but I absolutely cannot go for a walk for exercise. Walking is not intense enough and I end up ruminating and feel worse than ever the more I walk. The last few weeks of pregnancy my mental health was in the garbage after I was going on lots of walks to try to get labor going. I'm really not sure what I can do to get moving after the c-section. I don't even think I could do yoga as it requires too much core work. Walking is just not an option for me with the rumination and intrusive thoughts. Does anyone have any suggestions of what to do?",1
"I feel stress every day and apparently it's not normal? My whole adult life has been filled with stress, either lots of it before looming deadlines or smaller doses of every day stress like a general sense of worry about money, career, social interactions, time, etc. My partner doesn't experience this; he doesn't worry about something unless it's about to happen, because in his opinion, worrying won't help the situation. He's been down to his last $200 in a foreign country before and managed to find a job before his money ran out, so i guess his lack of stress was justified. He tells me all the time that I shouldn't be stressed so much because there's no point in doing so. On the other hand, I stress about everything because I feel that if I'm not stressing, I won't be prepared for when something unexpected happens. Like if I have a leaking pipe and need to spend thousands fixing the damage. How do you not feel the urgent need to make sure you have enough money to prepare for something like that? What's normal? Is it normal to be stressed every day? Or is it normal to not be stressed unless something big is about to occur? How do I stop worrying about things that are rationally beyond my control when a part of me believes that if I can anticipate it, I'll be prepared for when it happens? Ugh. Now I'm stressing about whether I'm too stressed. Life is stressful. Any ideas on how to stop stressing about every little thing?",1

"Tomorrow my depression will be one year old. I don't know if I need to celebrate or to complain my self. I am 18 years old, I am from Mexico and until a few months ago I realized that I could have something upset. At the beginning of August 2019 my life took a pretty good turn, everything was going to improve and it did. my school demanded so much time that I didn't have time for anything I was extremely happy. everything was going well, grades, friends, I was even going to start a relationship with a very special girl, my family had finally found a balance. When the pandemic arrived, I was not so affected, but it all started when my cousin decided to commit suicide on August 31, 2020, without any sign or warning, it was all very sudden. They asked me to give a few words at his funeral but I couldn't, and all those things that I still had to say I kept to myself. All this year I had good times and bad, but little by little everything rotted, my family separated completely, my school closed and that dream of having graduated from that school disappeared. After all, I filled many of my afternoons smoking marijuana and tried to fill in those little holes that I was living. In March it was the last time I saw my mother because of a stupid thing I did and that every day makes me feel guilty. I filled my days with depressing philosophy, I walked away from all my friends, my life really stopped. Sometimes I start to think and I imagine myself with a psychologist talking about my problems, and only realizing that my life is wrong, but what could it be wrong? I do not have any disability or something, some disease that prevents me from being happy. But problems overwhelm me and take my breath away, I am speechless in these situations. Sometimes I start to think what would have happened to me if the whole pandemic hadn't happened. I just wanted to share my story, thanks for reading )",1

"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another. Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful.

The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely.

"Gamers made me depressed I know that's a bold statement. I made a similar post on Reddit a while back. But it got deleted after my google account was suspended. Because of that and the fact that a Lot has transpired since then I figured I would repost the story here. As typical of pretty much everyone born since the 80s, I was into games ever since I was little. Got my Wii when I was 6, played Turok with my half-brother on his old gaming device, and poured hours into Minecraft. So as soon as I saw the trailer for Fallout 4 back in 2015 I was almost immediately hooked. I’ve always been a history buff along with being fascinated by dystopias and American nostalgia so Fallout seemed right up my alley. I was even more hyped when I saw a video from a YouTuber I liked at the time that talked about the Fallout universe and the lore behind it. Sadly I was only 11 at the time so it wasn't likely my parents would let me buy it. But I was patient and by 2017 I was finally able to play. Let me say I absolutely loved it. I thought the story was heart-wrenching and I fell in love with all the characters in the game. Over the next year, I went on to play both 3 and new vegas and loved them just as much. Although as time went on I started to realize people had different opinions as me. Which is fine. I want to make it clear right now that I do not have a problem with people disliking things I like. In Fact, there are plenty of other opinions in which I hold that are wildly unpopular online. Hell at first I wasn't even mad they disagreed with me. I just saw us as having a differing opinion and left it at that. But as I spent more time online. It became more and more annoying to see some of these fans talk. They seemed to act as if what they loved was objectively superior and then rub it in my face. This post is a good[ example]( and this[ one]( There are a lot more I could show you but I think you get the picture. Moving along, I was able to tune it all out. Even after Fallout 76 came out. A game that was reviewed so poorly it seemed to vindicate these fanboys. I personally didn't like 76 anyway and figured that most of the hate was independent of the hate for 3 and 4. So I continued to enjoy games as much up until the summer of 2019. But there was one last thing that truly kicked off my depression. There's a Fallout YouTuber called Oxhorn. He seemed like a decent YouTuber and I was even comforted by the fact that he seemed to be a big name in the community and liked Fallout 4. Well, I soon found that after Fallout 76 came out people were out there trying to cancal him. Some of the things people were saying about him let me down but I saw it as an opportunity to see these people for who they really were. People who were willing to smear someone for what they did or didn't like. People also seemed to side with Oxhorn when it came to his response which got a few hundred thousand views so I was at peace. Well, as if the universe wanted to fuck me over. The well-respected YouTuber The Right Opinion made his own video on the matter. One that got over a million views and effectively ruined my life. It seemed that the New Vagas fanboys won in the end. Their ability to smear people if they liked something they didn't. Calling them names while jacking off for the game that was special to them without consideration for what was special to me. Since then things have gotten much worse. Everywhere I look online people praise New Vegas and constantly use it to one-up 4. It's even extended to real life. I talked with a guy recently who claimed I had a bad taste in character and in games for expressing my opinions on New Vegas. Someone else chimed in and said “You do realize new vegas is the most critically acclaimed fallout game right” A message that’s been repeated to me again and again. Yes, I get it. Everyone fucking loves New Vegas. I loved it too. Everyone also hates Fallout 4. And apparently, I have shit taste in storytelling because I loved it as well. I get it. Maybe you're right. Maybe I’m just one big idiot whose opinions are invalid and no one agrees with them. That’s fine. But why do you gotta rub it in my face? Now I can't enjoy games anymore. All the fun just seemed to be sucked out of them. The sad part is I only really got to play four mature games on my own. The three Fallout games I already mentioned and a fourth one called “We Happy Few''. But after all this drama. It was taken away from me. The real Irony is that when I finally got the chance to play a game “The Outer Worlds” that was made by the original creators of Fallout, which these New Vegas fanboys were worshiping as a genius. I was already too depressed to play it It’s not even just Fallout, I can’t play a single game with the excitement and enthusiasm I once did. I guess that’s because of the gaming community in general. The instant fanboyism and hatred for companies that I couldn't give a shit about. I know you’ll probably argue I shouldn't let it get to me. Believe me for the longest time it didn't. But it just became too much. Now I've lost an important part of my life. It’s because of this I've been severely depressed for the past couple of years. Keep in mind this isn't the only reason I'm feeling this way. I don’t have many friends, I feel as if I fail at everything I do, and I’m just feeling like life has no meaning. So ya know typical depression bull shit. It’s just that gaming was a big coping mechanism for much of my life. So to have it stripped away from me as this has really caused me to become apathetic about pretty much everything. It makes me feel Like I can’t go on any longer. I actually went berserk recently and made many Reddit posts telling people they fucked up my life. I know that was Insane. But I didn't know what to do. I felt so alone. I felt like I knew one was listening. I went on to post a video onto youtube saying I was going to, you know, end it all. My dumb ass even had the balls to email Ign and demand them to spread my story. I know It’s crazy. Believe me, I was desperate. I just wanted people to understand how I felt. I know no one does. That’s fine. All I know Is I’m just depressed. You don’t have to understand if ya can’t. I just want people to listen. I know all this sounds dumb. I want to reiterate that this Isn't only just because of games. And Even if it was, they were pretty important to me. A Lot of you guys grew up on games. You must know what it’s like to be my age. It was something that kept me through the day and now it’s gone. I feel like my adolescence has been robbed from me. I was only 15 when I stopped enjoying games. Now I’m 17 and I don’t imagine I’ll have time for them in the future. I’d like to conclude on one note. If any of you ever held any opinions that were different from mine that’s fine. I’ve always respected them and I will continue to respect them. But if you acted cruelly or did everything you could to make me feel this way then congratulations. It’s because of you that my life feels empty. It’s because of you I’ve lost one of my favorite hobbies. I hope you're happy.",1
"There is no space for people like me Typing this out feels so painful and pointless. There is no space for men like me in this society. Men who don't fit in this society's definition of handsome or beautiful or sexy. It doesn't matter if you are a cheat or an abuser, a 25-30 BMI with a nice looking face is the free pass. By now you have decided put in one of those boxes called incel or something similar. I understand that. I would also have done that too a few years back. God, I don't even have the energy to tell the complete story and you don't have the time either. Long story short, my ex came in to my life 12 years ago to escape a mentally and physically abusive relationship. And WE found happiness. Proper happiness. Among the maddening chaos of med school and utter hopelessness of everything else, we shared laughter and tears. She loved me. I loved her. It isn't easy loving someone in a country we live in. People around us used to consider us constant(at least those 3 or 4 people who are my friends, although she was my only best friend ). I say this again - she was the only person in my 27 something years of my life who was kind to me. We shared each others trauma. She became my entire life and I was her entire life too... at least for 7 years or so. Then she walked away one day. 'It's not you it's me' - out of the blue. We almost got married. Almost. Over the years I have always been proud of our fidelity and loyalty and considered them to be the forte of whatever we had. I guess happy people look beautiful. Women approached me everyday. Mostly because of my career. I never looked sideways. She walked away to be with a friend from her med school in a matter of days. (I heard that he dropped her then girlfriend on a single day notice. He had practice) My entire world collapsed in a matter of moments. I entered my hell. I have been here for the last 4.5 years. No sleep cycle. No one to talk to. No respite. I have literally spent weeks or months in complete solitude. Not even my parents talk to me. When I say talk, I don't mean long conversations. I haven't heard a hello or a good morning or a happy birthday in these years. I stayed entirely mum for weeks at a stretch. I tried to kill myself 3 or 4 times. All I think of is a way to die peacefully. But she kept coming back quite a few times. This new guy supposedly abused her verbally and physically. But she went back because he was a 'poor thing'. Not economically - his parents are filthy rich and he doesn't feel any moral obligation, not to use that money. He is a poor thing because he suffers from liver disease due to excessive drinking and drugs. Did I mention that I am the prude who does not smoke and drinks socially literally TWICE a year on average? Oh and she accused me of emotional abuse and made up things so that she could justify going back to him. I am guilty of letting her repeat this cycle quite a few times. I love her. I can't help it. Only a kind word from her mouth soothes my soul. I had built my world around her bit by bit. I forgot all the childhood trauma, all those bullies, all those unkind words. I forgot I wasn't beautiful. She made me feel beautiful. I worshipped her. I was so thankful to God for finally making me happy. I thought it was our happily ever after. And then I lost everything. I can't face myself in the mirror. People don't approach me like before because they know something is broken. And the rest of them doesn't believe that we separated. So here I am. Typing this fucking thing out. The new loser creep. There is no sympathy for people like me in this society. I have tried to hate her with everything I have. I could not. I cannot. I just hate myself more for not being enough. Now I dream about my death in vivid details. I was the quite nerd in school. She made me come out my cocoon. And now I have nothing to survive. I haven't smiled or laughed in 4 years. I have suffered death of loved ones and more misfortunes. I have been backstabbed by people whom I considered to be close. From a promising academic talent to a useless recluse. I don't think I can be a good doctor anymore. If you read this, thanks for listening. Mental health care is not available where I live. Thank you for reading this.",1
"I feel like my mental health professionals don't care but I can't tell if that's the depression talking Hi! I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this question. I don't normally like to discuss my mental health problems because I think that makes my problems feel worse, but I need some outside judgement here. I'll keep this as quick as possible, but I'm afraid it's still going to be a little long. I'm in a partially hospitalized mental health program, which means that I go to a hospital 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. I see psychiatrists and therapists there, but I fill my own prescriptions at my local pharmacy. I've been in this program 3 weeks, with \~1 to go. At the beginning of the program, the psychiatrist wanted to adjust the dose of one of my medicines. Instead of just ordering a prescription for pills at the new dose, she decided to order 30 pills which were each about a third of the new dose, so that I could take a little more or less as she thought appropriate. From the beginning, she told me to take 3/day. I took 3/day, so the 30 pills only lasted 10 days. I had to really bug my therapist to get a new appointment with the psychiatrist after that 10 days was up, even though this medicine is one of the ones you can't just stop taking safely. Finally, I got to see her 13 days from when she wrote the original prescription, which was this last Friday. When I went to fill the new prescription at about 4 that afternoon, the pharmacy tech told me that my insurance wouldn't cover the new pills because my psychiatrist had written ""one a day"" on the original prescription. He said he could give me the pills, but I'd have to pay the full sticker price of $780 instead of my nice co pay ($0). I stayed calm because I thought this was just a stupid mistake and called my psychiatrist, who nonchalantly told me that the pharmacy tech was wrong and that I should just be ""more assertive"" about filling the prescription. If that didn't work, she said, I could try Good RX. I tried Good RX, and only got $40 off. I called back, this time panicking a bit, at exactly 4 17 pm. The secretary informed me that the psychiatrist had ""just walked out,"" but offered to refer me to my therapist. My therapist was kind, but said something which boiled down to ""Friday at 4 is almost Friday at 5, and no one here is going to be able to help you on Friday at 5."" I ended up coming back the next day and, with the help of Good RX and the incredibly kind pharmacy tech, getting the pills for $113. I just want to know is the program's response (or lack thereof) normal? Are most mental health professionals this laid back about seemingly urgent stuff or do mine really just not care? I have only had 1 other psychiatrist and she's awesome (I plan on returning to her after this program), so I know she would never do this. The depressed, hopeless voice in the back of my brain is telling me that these people really don't give a fuck and that I should just give up and not return for my last week. Whether or not that is a reasonable conclusion, how can I push myself to go back to the program despite feeling hurt and confused by this? Thanks in advance for your help! Edit I just realized while taking my Abilify that she wrote ""1/2 tablet daily"" on the prescription of 30 tablets. I was only supposed to take 1/2 of a tablet for the first 6 days, after that she told me to take 1 tablet a day. Does this mean my insurance won't cover a refill of the Abilify until 60 days have passed????? This is more rhetorical, because I think I know the answer. I know I'm really lucky in a way because my financial position is safe enough that this isn't a huge issue, but I want to scream at these people. The pharmacy tech said this is basic prescriber knowledge, and I'm pretty certain he wasn't wrong. ",1
"My anxiety and professor are going to kill me Hi, I am from India I don't know what is going to happen next in my life. There is a huge uncertainty that is killing me from inside. Its related to my career and how my college professor is hell bent to take it away from me despite the covid situation around here. I have no one I can turn to for help. Each day i wake up with a high bp and heart rate. My bp and anxiety remains high so much that i can't sleep and remain awake for 10 hrs straight. Finally my heart and brain eventually tire themselves out so much due to excessive pumping and overthinking that i can sleep for an hour and then I wake up and the cycle continues. My professor wants to have a vendetta on me. Despite me facing financial crisis and my teammates experiencing high stress situation after they and their entire family turning out covid positive we tried to implement our project work. However my professor didn't even bother to guide us or even understand the situation we had been through. At age of 22 when i am about to have a good job at a renowned IT company I am facing anxiety attack as my professor has displayed a full fledged threat of failing us and ruining our career. Neither she nor anyone else is ready to listen to my side of the story. No one is here to see my pain. I simply can't live like this. I don't deserve all this. And now I am supposed to fail and repeat and eventually loose my career which hasn't even begun all because of a situation of crisis that wasn't in our control and because of a vengeful professor and her ego.",1

"Do you think that your mind has a 'mind' of its own? Without even realizing, our mind seems to be governed by another entity which is called the sub-conscious mind.

"This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like  When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it. EDIT Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you. ""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on. And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free. But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on. At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point? You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant. By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel. When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape."" EDIT 2 Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in. ""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""",1

I have had social anxiety for a few years now and I don’t care how painful death is, it’s better than the torture this is. (Sorry if that sounds cringe) Due to the social anxiety I have no social connections of any type outside of my single mother. I haven’t gone through anything bad in my life, but I don’t think you really need a justification for killing your self other than it is what I have chosen to do. If my social anxiety went away I would want to live to the rest of my life, but it is impossible to get rid of (yes I’ve tried medication and therapy.

"What the???? Throwaway. Hear me out, please. I feel as if my life will never get better. I just started college after a horrendous high school experience complete with bullying and exclusion. College isn't shaping up to be much better so far despite inspiring words by those around me and personal hopes. I spend my days after class wandering around looking for people to hang out with. I sometimes get a few snapchats for later contacts but they never really turn out to be anything. I feel incredibly lonely and it's going on 5 years of this. I don't know what to do/I don't know if I can do it. It's like God really wants me to eradicate myself. I really want to find myself a group of friends that 110% enjoys me for who I am. I want to find myself a girl that 110% enjoys me for who I am. Getting here to college has intensified a lot of things, not just the loneliness. All of the guys around me are rushing but since I'm trans, I don't feel comfortable doing so. That makes me even more depressed because if I wasn't trans, I would be able to do something like that. I'm at risk of getting the shit kicked out of me for trying to join a frat just because I'm trans. Me being trans also makes things difficult finding a girlfriend. I'm 18 damn years old and have never had anything beyond a platonic hug. Kinda pathetic and I want to change that asap. I'm not ugly, I'm just trans and I don't think many girls in Southern Virginia want a trans dude. I'm really struggling to find a solution to the pain I'm feeling.

"I've never felt so sad, alone, lonely, and isolated before. At the same time I want to stay isolated. I don't want to socialize or be around people. I don't quite understand what's going on with me. I might be broken. I know that I ""can"" talk to friends and family about my feelings but at the same time I just ""feel"" like there is no one I can talk to. Nor do I possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud. Whenever I try talking with a friend I just clam up. I don't understand myself. I don't understand why I am like this.

It's good to hear that you aren't too upset anymore. Did you maybe want to play some video games later or hang out? Oh you're busy? No problem. Just let me know if anything changes. Hey what's going on? Sorry I'm kinda busy right now, but I can talk with you soon if you'd like. I'm sorry that you feel that way right now, but I'll always be free when you need to get something off your chest. Hey, what are you up to today? Did you want to do something with me today? You're busy tonight? No problem, just let me know if plans change. You needed to talk about something? I'm all ears, what's been bothering you?

"How I Learned to Control my Migraines Hey guys, I thought I'd share my story of dealing with migraines. I used to start getting them for what I thought was absolutely no reason. I was always an anxious person, but when I started my first job after college, I started getting these stress migraines, and they were debilitating. I would come home from work and just lie down for hours until I fell asleep, only to wake up with the pain the next day. The underlying cause was stress, and I would experience other bodily manifestations of my stress such as bloating, excessive sweating, and sleep issues. As you can imagine, my body was a wreck. While I still experience these feelings from time to time, I have them significantly more under control and rarely get these uncomfortable feelings. Here's how I was able to take care of them. First and foremost, while I did meditate and it did help, I realized the underlying cause was that I wasn't focusing on the task in front of me, and was instead trying to multitask. When you try and multitask, you cause anxiety. Anxiety is ""being here but wanting to be there."" This would take a toll on my mental energy. Once I stopped trying to multitask and focus only on the task at hand, my migraines started to become less frequent. Meditation helps with this because you are asked to practice concentration. Next, when I experienced these feelings, I approached them with a sense of curiosity. Why was my body reacting this way? Instead of getting upset at our body, like most of us do when we get these feelings, I started listening to my body. I realized that stress and anxiety are trying to tell me something. These emotions are my ally as opposed to my enemy. I came up with a great analogy as to why I was getting these migraines. When you consistently put unhealthy food inside your body, what happens? You get a stomach ache. When you consistently put unhealthy thoughts inside your mind, you get a mind-ache, or a migraine! Once I came up with that analogy, I was more mindful of what thoughts I was letting inside of my mind. You'll be surprised with the kind of garbage you let inside of your mind. That's what these feelings are telling you, so becoming curious about them really helped. By this point, I was experiencing the physical manifestations of stress a lot less frequently, but I was still experiencing them. This brings me to my final point. Trust and believe in the process. These won't disappear overnight. However, if you noticed changed up until now (which I did), I trusted the process, and eventually, I almost virtually eliminated them. I hope that helps those of you who are suffering from stress-related migraines. I tried to keep this as short and digestible as possible, so I left out a lot of detail. But please comment or PM me if you want me to expand on anything further. I know how much these suck, so I'm happy to help out further if I can.",1

"Stress is causing pain, which is making stress worse. What to do? Hi! I discovered not too long ago that when I'm really stressed out, I get pains in my abdomen. I know that it's stress and not something more sinister because the first two times it happened, I was extremely stressed, and I went to my doctor, who could find nothing wrong with me, physically. The pain in my abdomen, while I know is not harmful, still freaks me out. It occurs on the right side, and is often low, which of course makes me jump right to appendicitis. Then I start hyper focusing on that and stressing myself out more, which in turn makes the pain worse, it's a pretty vicious cycle. I am currently on medication for GAD, but it doesn't seem to be doing much to help. I have a doctors appointment in a week and a half and plan on speaking to her about maybe switching medications, but is there anything that I can do to manage my stress until then? While it does subside on its own, it's still quite miserable and kind of scary. Thanks!",1

"Help coping with extreme, long term stress? I'm going crazy Hi, I'm 18, and I've been non stop stressed since mid-March. It started during spring break, when all of my roommates went home except for me. I'm really bad at being alone. It made me so anxious and stressed that I got the flu and a severe UTI, as well as abdominal pain. Later, because I was stressed about the UTI, I got really bad chest pain. Then, I started my first major curriculum class, which stressed me out because the teacher was tough and I was the only freshman. Then we had to choose housing and there wasn't enough housing for every student (good job, school), so that had me freaking out pretty horribly. Then, it was time to move out of the freshman dorms, which was a bit overwhelming. In May, my dad told me that he was selling his house, and he wasn't very nice about it. I'm really emotionally attached to that house, so that's stressing me out a lot too. The thought of leaving it makes me want to just lay down on the floor and cry (in fact, I have done so), and he's not being sympathetic at all (as in, when I get sad about it he tells me to grow the hell up). So that's a *constant* stresser. THEN, my dad and my aunt got in a massive fight, and my dad pulled out of helping me buy my plane ticket to visit her in LA. My friends had already gotten their tickets, and I had to find a way to get mine on my own (my place of work closed in January, and I need so much time off this summer that nobody in their right mind would hire me). All the while, I was caught right in the middle of their insane argument. I got really close to cancelling the trip. That was the catalyst for my current predicament, I think. I am currently sick, and I have been for two weeks. I feel horrible all of the time, and get nauseous and dizzy after eating. My heartbeat skyrockets, and I get really shaky too. I saw my GP, and after a physical examination, she chalked it up to all of the stress coming down pretty hard on me. I can't keep letting this stress rule over me like this. It's literally making me sick. What are some ways that I can go about coping with it and keeping it from kicking me to the ground like this? I've gotta do something. I am on medication, but since it's a new prescription, it's going to be a month or so before I see any real improvement.",1

"I will never understand how people can live and be happy Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me.

"how to overcome ptsd in a new relationship? straight to the point, when i was 16 i was in a toxic relationship where my ex boyfriend, 22 at the time, attempted to manipulate me into refraining from speaking to my male best friends and i almost lost them in the process trying to fulfill his desires being the people pleaser i am. this, among other toxic shit, resulted in trauma. my current boyfriend is completely different. he's a sweetheart, but sometimes my male best friends' behaviors tick him off. usually it isn't anything major; just stuff that my boyfriend finds annoying like overly friendly physical contact and whatnot. he would point that out and i, out of fear of repeating the traumatizing past i had with my ex, would go on to defend/justify their actions in a way it seems like i'm attacking him or forcing my opinions and friendships down his throat. it had become a reoccurring problem of me continuously defending my friends and unintentionally putting them above my relationship in fear that i might lose them again and end up alone in case we ever break up. sometimes my boyfriend would lose his temper during those arguments, after having them for more than one or two times, and that resulted in more fear on my part. i know he's not trying to do the same shit my ex tried to pull off, but it's not something i can easily control. yesterday he told me that he's starting to feel like i don't prioritize him in the relationship. he said he feels like a second option, if anything at all, and this contributed in his depression. he doesn't think it's gonna work out anytime soon in terms of this specific topic. how should i deal with it and what is your advice to overcome the ptsd i have from my past experience with a toxic relationship?",1

The world is collapsing and he wanted to abandon me to live in a mountain by the lake in Chattanooga. He just stopped taking coffee and it could be just his withdrawal symptoms. That is another thing. His mom, his sister and himself were all extremely addicted to alcohol and caffeine. They all tried other drugs in schools but I don’t think they are taking them anymore.

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer... About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions. So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus. The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software. The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU. Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is. It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one. Edit Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had )",1
"unsure how to help more I personally have been dealing with depression and a few other things for quite a few years. However, im still at a loss on how to help my suicidal sister and im looking for advice. My depression has never got to the point of suicidal thoughts so im unsure how to really help. My sister is older than me and has ocd, depression, aspergers and ptsd. My sister has been on/off suicidal for more than four years now and she is very vocal to me about it. I am the only family member she will tell also. Almost every time I see her when i'm back home, she tells me that she wants to kill herself and it used to be even more often to the point where i couldn't focus on school anymore. She also asks me for suicide methods and basically asks me for advice on how to kill herself. I usually try to sit down and listen to her vent about why shes feeling that way but i feel like it never helps. I have also recommended the suicide hotline as another form of help bc i didnt know what to do. Me and my other sister have had to get her checked into a psych ward a few times when she started making a suicide plan (last time it happened was last week). She lives with a really toxic mother (not my mom) and also has a lot of trauma from our dad. I have tried to help her make a plan to get out of that living situation but she doesnt try to. She also barely tells her therapist whats going on and wants to quit. I am unsure what else I can do. And to be honest, I am getting very drained having to be told that she is going to kill herself every time she leaves my house. I also have things im dealing with. This has been going on for years to the point where I avoid talking to her because Im afraid she will tell me shes going to kill herself again. TLDR; sister suicidal for years and only tells me, refuses help, idk what to do anymore and im very drained",1

"Thank you for existing and so grateful to have you in my life I know you since we were 13 years old. We went to the same high school together, you were my classmate once, but somehow we never been in the same group of friends, i used to have my own group of friends and same goes to you. But deep down, among all friends that i had and have in my life, you’re always my best friend. The bestest that i have! We never declared that we’re best friends, we don’t text each other every day but no matter what, whenever any one of us feel like shit and depressed and so tired of people, we know we can always reach out to each other. And because of that, I’m so grateful to have you in my life. And i want nothing but the best for you in this life. Thank you for being such a wonderful friend to me! Iloveyou!!",0
"Give everyone your all, receive none in return. Even if it’s a matter of life or death. It’s times like these where I realize that no matter how hard I try, I’m worth nothing to these people. God forbid I talk about depression or my struggles with diabetes. I’ve insulted them and their ancestors as well as every God known to man. I hate my self for wanting validation from them. I hate myself for trying to be the bigger better person. I just hate my self. I recently got diagnosed with diabetes, we’re still figuring out the proper dosage for me. It’s super tricky, not enough meds and my blood sugar is always high. Enough meds, my blood sugar crashes hard. When I first got diagnosed my sister threw a fit about how it was basically my fault I got diabetes. Mind you, I’m a dentist, other sister is a dentist, other sister (her bestie) is a physician. She has plenty of medical knowledge. Three hours ago, she called me while I was trying to sleep. I didn’t pick up. She texted me on every platform you can think of. When I answered, she told me she was worried because her BF is “tired” and she doesn’t know why. I told her a number of things and when she asked for details, I told her to freaking google it. She said I was being insensitive. 5 minutes later, I apologized twice and went into detail. 15 minutes later, I hear her going up the stairs to her bedroom. 5 minutes after that I feel “unease”. Check my blood sugar, so low I freaked out thinking I might die there. Not that it would be a horrible thing but if I do go, I want it to end in peace with no drama. I barely get downstairs because I want to make a sugary oatmeal dish and call her to ask for help because at that point I couldn’t see. She threw a fit about me waking her up. She knows how life threatening extreme blood sugar readings can be. I just simply don’t matter.",1

"Techniques to handle stress that work? I've taken up two online jobs with low pay in order to support my family in lockdown, and it's starting to take a toll on my mental health.

"Just needing a place to vent My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass. Our family members don’t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards. I just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can’t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn’t. Anyway, if you’ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling. Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you. ",1
"Money and corona stress Ok now I can’t legally get a job because of my age but the only person in my family who has a job is my dad remember that. My mom is very much insane she abuses us, a lot, and spends a ridiculous amount of money on cigarettes and wine and other non necessities. Now we don’t have a lot of money we have enough to pay the bills buy food and get small joys so aside from the mom thing we live happy but no where close to wealthy that really doesn’t bother me.

"What emergency stress relief strategies/remedies do you use? I had my first attempt at a driving test last week. I didn’t just mess up the parallel parking at the beginning; I messed up a lot of dumb things on my way back to the DPS parking lot. This past weekend I had my graduation. My anxiety over taking good pics turned me into a “grad-zilla” squinting_face_with_tongue . I already take meds that help a lot with keeping my anxiety controlled. I’ve been inconsistent with exercise and meditation but I’m sure I’ll get that figured out someday lol. My main question is what can I do for immediate relief when I feel the stress building on my body? I’m nervous that when I take the driving test again a week from now, the anxiety will kill me again. I’d appreciate any and all advice on this. Thanks",1
"How do you deal with stress? I'm sure everyone deals with stress at some point in their life. I am currently at that point and have been trying to manage it for over a year now. I can't seem to find the ""perfect"" stress reliever. It has gotten to the point that I cannot sleep comfortably; most days I feel as if I am on autopilot. I tried exercising but it only made things worse. I'm convinced my norepinephrine neurotransmitters don't function properly. Anyways, what are some things that have helped you relieve stress?",1
"Stress is starting to overcome my life. Help? I have always been stressed. When I was in my teenage years, I had migraines everyday. Medically unexplained. For years. Turns out it was just my body's way of coping with stress. I have been better at handling said stress with the years. I am now doing pretty good at handling myself with a normal level of stress. However, I am still handling stress badly when it is a new amount of stress (for example here, new job, bought an apartment w/ my boyfriend but things are not so good between us, having to move to a new place, a friend living on my couch for some time...) It is tiring for me to be under stress like that. It makes me cry randomly, have bad headaches and lash out a lot. I don't want to, but it seems like my stress needs to escape my body in any possible way. I am comfortable around my boyfriend, so it happens a lot that I am losing it around him because it feels like a safe environment. It is however making my relationship more difficult than it should be, to the point where he says he is really considering ending it. Any idea how I could help coping with my stress in a bit of an healthier way?",1

"Have you ever felt anxiety taking over your stomach? I did untill I sat down and put all my attention on that area affected by my anxiety and started to slowly consciously guide my breath there. What happened next was so unreal to me at that time. I felt that area, which was hot from anxiety, become cold and colder as the ""stuck"" energy was being dispelled and after a while it felt as if I swallowed an ice cube which reached the depth of my stomach to that location. To me this says a lot about how important it is to consciously breathe at specific times. For example did you know that certain diseases thrive in an oxygen less body? The most interesting thing about breathing I learned is that it is one of the many expressions from what many would call prana (chi, life-force, prana, qi, ki, pitī, rapture, chills, spiritual chillls, goosebumps, ecstasy, euphoria, aura, mana, ruah, nephesch and many more). I made this [YouTube video]( for you if you are interested in these concepts.",1
"No genuine interest in anything. Everything I do, that I ""seem"" to enjoy is just so I don't become more depressed. I lift weights and exercise, I play pc games, watch some Netflix movies and YouTube videos/music. If I could I would end my life this instant. I'd also want to end all life in the universe, but that's another story. I'm pretty dead inside and just living to die. I've been depressed on and off for the past 10 years, mostly because life is pointless and I think it's better to be dead then alive. So even if I was happy, I'd prefer to end my life, philosophically speaking, again as I think it's better to be dead then alive. I was thinking the other day that if I was told to go to work tomorrow (I don't current work), that I would be given 400k, I really could be bothered going and probably wouldn't. I mean I don't care about money and actually fantasize about being homeless. Basically, I can't overcome my depression due to the **fact** that life is pointless.",1
"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself ) I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak... I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away. **I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. )",1
"struggling recently I'm using this subreddit as kind of a way to vent because I feel awful for telling my girlfriend these things almost everyday for the past few weeks. Life has been kind of sucky lately, and it is almost entirely because of me. I feel like my (m) relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart because of my stress (hence my posting here), insecurities, paranoia, and anxiety. I saw her over break on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day as well as a few times when I have visited at work. But we haven't been able to hang out, by ourselves, to just talk face to face (partly because she is busy and partly because of her parents). For context, we usually hung out many days a week before and after school. I, however, have convinced myself she does not want to see me, and is therefore avoiding me. I think that she just doesn't really like me much anymore, which sucks, because AFAIK she does, and she tells me she does, but I tell myself otherwise. I have convinced myself she likes someone else, or likes something in a guy that I don't have. I feel bad for talking to her about my thoughts and feelings because I feel like I am burdening her with them. I feel like she views me as weak, unattractive, and all the other bad things. I am beginning to think she just wants to leave, but just isn't. I have convinced myself of these things, despite having ZERO evidence to support it, other than the things I misconstrue and misinterpret as evidence. I have already begun searching for therapists for myself, but I fear the damage may be done. I don't know what to do anymore, for me or for her, to make it better. I feel like an awful boyfriend, and I feel less-than. I want to do better by her, because I really love her and want to salvage our relationship and make things okay again. I hypothesize sometimes about social media's impact on my thoughts, almost everywhere I turn on Reddit, Twitter, or Instagram I see a meme, tweet, or advice post about a cheating, lying, or otherwise shitty spouse/SO, and so I seem to have misrepresented the whole of relationships because of the part that I see online. I don't know. Thanks for reading my long and boring rant. tl;dr - life sucks because I feel bad, sad, and I worry a lot. feel like my relationship with my girlfriend is falling apart. trying to do better, but don't know how to.",1
"I don't care about anything anymore About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal? I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education. I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive? My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless. What the fuck am I supposed to do with myself? What the fuck is wrong with me?",1

Scared about my future I’m in the final year of my degree. This is generally the time I need to start searching and applying for jobs.

"I have a lot of things going on at the same time and it’s making me stressed to the point I feel sick. I’m hoping that somehow me typing all this out will help me overcome everything and make me feel better. I started a new job in the beginning of November. Everything was going good until Thanksgiving. My fiancée and I made the decision we would visit family that day. In hindsight, that was stupid. The day after, my sister started feeling sick and tested positive for COVID, and then her family was getting sick and the ones that got tested were positive. My work told me I had to quarantine, but since I was new, they wouldn’t give me paid leave. That left we with 2 weeks of not getting any money. Thankfully, I had some savings to help scrape by on bills, but I had to go through all of that. Since then, I’ve been struggling and the end of the month bill marathon has been cutting it too close. Had a lot of unexpected expenses. We’ve been living in a 1 bedroom apartment and we are wanting to move into a house because we have no room for anything. Had to store a lot of belongings in our cars. We are also planning a wedding for the end of October. I’m trying to go back to school so I don’t have to work a 3rd shift factory job for the rest of my life.

"Can stress affect memory and focus? This is probably a dumb question, but I feel so dumb recently. I was the best in my grade at science, maths and extension science last year but now I'm in year 11. I make so many dumb mistakes. I did a formative, missing 5 of 27 marks on the dumbest of things. Most of the time about half of my work is wrong because of dumb mistakes. My memory is also worse, from the point that I could remember most things without studying them, now I forget how to do it within days without study. This leads to more stress because I think I'm getting dumber and there might be something wrong with my brain (thanks health anxiety). I've been more stressed recently and was also more than usual stressed last year when it began. Is it common for these sorts of things to happen with stress? ",1
"I’m tired of being this stressed My dad and I have always had the best relationship. some days he felt more as freind, but allways knew when to turn “dad mode” on. Iv allways respected him for that.

It works by attacking your nerves and slowly over time will paralyze you. Well that’s what most people get, some loose sight,hearing,taste,ability to swallow or talk, and all felling. Less then ten percent get that bad but considering that my dad is at the point most people get at in 20 years done in 2 hes probably going to get that bad. Well he would have if he did’t make a decision. I support what he’s going to do just because I don’t want him in That personal hell. He is going to kill him self before he gets that bad…. I live with him so I can see him getting worse by the day and I’m scared that day might be getting close. I am the only one living with him in fact. I’m staying till his end because there’s no one else who is willing to help so even if I wanted to leave I can’t. He’s lucky I love him so much or I would be ubset over this.

Depression took over my life followed by anxiety and emotional numbness affected my life emotionally and mentally to a point of no return I wake up with headaches and sleep with headaches The only 5 mins I feel completely free from anything is the 5 min after I wake up my head is empty light as a feather I literally fight with myself to not remember anything and just enjoy the little amount of peace I have left before my nightmare of a day begins I've lost the ability to be happy over the years due to alot of stuff happening my cousin dying of cancer my first and only GF that I have felt genuinely attached to and BTW our relationship comes and goes but I couldn't stay friends with her and see her with other men it hurt me so I chose to just fade away and am not surprised that hasn't tried to contact me or anything but just hurtful My aunt who was my best friend and only friend till the 7th grade died and it broke me so much the very first girl I liked for 3 years (from the 7th grade to 9th grade) whom I worked on myself to be a good man for her in the future When I approached her she made fun of me and humiliated me and it destroyed me by the high school first year everyone know each other I was lonely I made some friends here and there but still didn't feel anything Then I met my EX GF I mentioned earlier and she broke many many times on and off till i broke it of completely and it hurts so much it's like a fire burning and eating me alive inside out I tried to shake it off find other hobbies but I didn't I didn't cuz I am not talented I have no hobbies I have nothing that am good at yet I keep smiling to the point where smiling became my hobby i smile in the face of people and laugh at their jokes but that's only because am used to doing it to the point it became like an automatic response a forced and uncomfortable habit My mouth hurts when I smile socializing with my friends when I go out hurts the most all of them are talented and in better colleges than myself I envy them sometimes having great and bright future but then I remember am not as talented as they are My emotional numbness has been increasing lately rapidly...few months ago my father burned his by mistake I watched as my sister and mother trying to cool his leg and the blood coming out getting creams and first aid I stood there and watched and felt nothing absolutely nothing wondering what the hell is wrong with me At first I thought my depression started when the first girl I liked made fun of me and humiliated me but then I realized I had the depression since I was young maybe because I was alone and had no friends maybe because Everytime I force myself to socializing things turn awkward or take a left turn During the pandemic I loved the idea of wearing face masks hiding my face and my emotions was something that made me feel comfortable and confident also wearing a hoodie I was like a ghost walking around not worried about what people think of me I have suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday couple months ago a neighbor's daughter was my age (20yrs old) committed suicide threw herself from a 12th floor hitting her head in the middle of the street at night and I happend to pass by and see her lying on the ground like that feeling absolutely nothing again I've lost the ability to love to talk to socialize to be happy and enjoy life and am not the type of guy who can move on tried to move from my ex but failed miserably so after many many attempts I gave up trying All I am is a walking talking idiot who's smiling and laughing with people forcibly who can't stop himself from doing it cuz if I did I'll be giving them blank faces and that's way worse thats why I prefer face mask so no one can Jude me IDK why am typing this post but the thought of suicide is always on my mind IDK if or when I am going to do it but incase I did I wanted to let everyone know my story Am scared of myself of what I will become if I let depression anxiety hate anger and negativity take complete control over IDK what monster I'll be I already did horrific things that am not proud of that I do not wish to speak of but they are bad and pretty fucking messed up whoever I have locked up inside is bottling out slowly getting stronger every day IDK how long I can hold it but sooner or later I will have to let him come to the surface And when that happens i don't think I'll be able to heal from it in the end am just A Constant in a Sea of Variables- Mr Robot,1
"Happiness really is a privilege Growing up I never thought about it like that. I always thought happiness was just something everyone eventually had and that it was just the norm, and that anyone who wasn’t happy was some outcast. Now I see happiness really is a privilege, and I don’t say this in spite. If you are happy, that’s amazing, but also I think there are a lot of people who don’t realize how lucky they are to be happy. It truly boggles my mind that there are people who go to bed excited for the next day, it’s a feeling I don’t think I can remember having, at least for a very very long time.",0

Can’t handle littlest of stress I can’t handle when things don’t go just right. I fly off the handle mentally and just cannot relax. So hard to relax. How do I teach my brain that sometimes in life things just don’t go your way. I know this is fact but can’t seem to accept it. Thanks,1
"I learned of a kitchen life hack, tried it, and it really seems to be working!!! So usually after a week of buying potatoes, they start to sprout even though I have them in what is a dark cool place. And I would remove the sprouts only for the sprouts to come back again two days later. I looked online and apparently if you put apples in the same place as potatoes, it helps keep them from sprouting. Onions actually have the opposite effect and makes potatoes sprout faster. I tried it. I had two Fuji apples that I put in with a dozen potatoes, and I haven't seen a single sprout so far.",0
"Some people are just never depressed I remember months ago when my boyfriend told me he doesn’t think he’s ever really been depressed before. Hearing him say that completely blew my mind because my life has been the exact opposite for as long as I can remember and if I had the same kind of experience as him, I’d be in such a better place right now. I used to think people like that would crumble the moment something really bad happens to them but in all honesty, it seems to be a strength rather than a weakness. His dog who he really loved recently died and he was sad for maybe a week or two but then just bounced right back from it like nothing even happened. Can’t imagine what that must be like. I’m happy for him since I’d hate to see him have to suffer through that but also admittedly envious. Guess some people are just lucky enough to never have to experience this kind of daily hell that never really goes away.",0

"I’ve been getting headaches and nausea for over 3 weeks now. How do I relieve this stress? Hi. I’m going into my junior year of high school and I have a lot of summer work to get out of the way. I told myself in early June that I would get all of it out of the way before the school year even ended. The first day is on September 5th and I just got started. At first, I lacked the motivation to get the work done because I was so comfortable with my leisurely summer routine. Now I’m absolutely desperate to get it out of the way. From mid July to now, I’ve been getting raging headaches and nausea. (While I haven’t actually gotten sick yet, I feel like I’m about to) I keep myself up at night just planning my agenda to get my stuff done, only for me to decide not to and stress about it. When I would complete my work I would feel slightly better, only for the headache and nausea to come back a day later. Even when I’m not thinking about my pile of work I still feel like garbage. I still have 3 two page essays to write and one more book to finish and I’m leaving for vacation this Friday. I want to get this work done beforehand and hopefully not have these symptoms while I’m away from home. How can I relieve this stress within a short period of time?",1

"It doesn't matter if I'm interested or not, if you're happy, I'm happy I wanted to post this somewhere, and i figured this subreddit was the best place. I apologize for any weird formatting, I'm on my phone. . So, I have this best friend, ""J"", and he plays video games all the time. Several hundreds of Steam hours spent playing everything from fps games to strategy/survival games and the like. About a year and a half ago, he invited me to his discord server so I could hang out and meet his other friends. I would join to talk or play a few games with him an his friends, but for the most part J would stream whatever game he was currently playing for me to watch while i just hung out and talked to him. Now, I enjoy watching him play, I really do. It's pretty entertaining most times. But sometimes he plays games that just aren't as interesting for me to watch. But have I ever told him that? No. Why? Because I love hearing him talk. He gets excited about this game and will narrate his actions as he plays. He will start talking nonstop, either to me or just to himself, and gets more animated as the night goes on. Half of the time I understand it, but the other half I'm completely lost. It's very confusing and because of that I don't get as immersed. But the reason I keep asking him to stream his game for me, is because I love listening to him talk about it. I don't think he knows how much I love to listen to him. If he's passionate about it, then I'm more than happy to listen to him talk for hours, and enjoy how happy he sounds.",0
"Any advice for dealing with debilitating neck tension? Hey y’all. I (29M) have been struggling for the last few months with pretty severe neck tension caused from a combination of decades of stress and poor posture. The tension has been so bad, that it’s been shooting nerve pain to my hand, and there was even a brief week long period where I couldn’t move my neck much at all.

"I cried for 40 minutes after someone very close to me told me they were proud of me My dad passed away when I was 5 years old. Since then, I've lived my life along side my strong, amazing, beautiful, caring mom and my little sister. She served as my boulder in hard time, while she was herself going through a decade long grief. She kept a stoic face for her children when she was hurting inside, working hard in order to give us the best future and the best opportunities as well as a comfortable lifestyle. My dad had a best friend, my uncle (also my godfather). My uncle has children, and when he was still alive, we participate din everyone of his family event where I would hang out with my (non biological) 'cousins' all the time. My dad was a big family man and I consider my uncle to be my second father. Growing up, I didn't think that having a dad was a big deal. I had lived my whole life (almost) without one, and in my head, I think that my mom serves as both my father and mother figure. But there were times where I would think about my dad, be sad, and wish that I was a daddy's little girl, had a protective father, a dad on whom I could lean on whenever etc... When I watched Disney's The Good Dinosaur or the Lion King I would break down crying because I could truly relate to the story on a deeper level. Today, my uncle gave me 200 euros and told me he was extremely proud of me as he hugged me. He said it was a present for my hard work throughout the years and for my BAC (a big test 12 graders take in France). I was not expecting this at all. I was happy that my second dad, told me that. And it felt like my own dad was telling me this through him. I felt really emotional. I was extremely happy, and grateful. I'm still crying writing this and people might not read this but I want to remember this moment forever. I",0

Each month we pool the money together and go out and find awesome organizations and people to share it with. We have made 3 “gives” and it makes all of us incredibly happy to know we can all make an impact! So far we have bought new uniforms and equipment for a youth soccer club in Ghana, purchased water filtration systems that will last for 10 years for families in Haiti and sponsored the training of a new dog therapy team in Florida.

"Slow suicide Honestly, I don’t see how therapy could even help me at this point. I am currently starving myself because I hate my appearance, especially my chubby face. I assume I’m suffering from bdd..but it doesn’t matter because I don’t want to get treatment anyway. I don’t agree with the notion that I deserve a happy life.Not only that but I would have to once again..like with most things in my life, redefine my definition of happiness, which I refuse to. Just because there’s people like me who have managed to live a “meaningful” life doesn’t mean I should or could.If I were them I wouldn’t want to live either. Looking and living with my face..as well as imagining my life and future with it..makes me feel like death...like when someone you love dies..that grief. When you cry all the time because you can’t cope with the futility of the situation..there’s nothing you can do and this is your life now and forever. Crying and feeling the worst pain ever..being able to calm down for a while..distracting yourself, participating in life..whatever life looks like for you..only to remember and start crying again. Imagine the first few days or weeks after someones death..but feeling like that every day for months and years. Seeing myself makes me sick, I gag and lose my appetite, will to do anything, if I saw myself..I’d shoot myself in the face. Being at this stage, where I am cold all the time, in pain from not eating, having heart palpitations..feeling like I’m dying..makes me feel happy. People try to warn me, share their concerns..as if they’re not feeding into my disorder. As if death scares me. Honestly, I love seeing myself rot, slowly rotting away, feeling the flesh disappearing,knowing some day I won’t have to be conscious in this body anymore and all that’s going to be left of me is going to be bones.

I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed. Edit Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day.",1
"“It’s okay not to be okay” Please shut the fuck up. No, it isn’t. No one really believes that. What you really mean is it’s okay to not be okay as long as it doesn’t affect your life in any way. As long it’s something quirky or fucking cute like anxiety or mild depression (not the crazy bipolar type, though!). As long as you can still be productive and fucking perfect. Schizophrenic? Psychopathic? Paranoid? Terminally angry? You’re a sick freak who needs to be locked up. It’s even worse when it’s schools spouting this hippie, pop-psychology bullshit. You know you’re only trying to cover your bases for when some kid slashes their wrists. I promised I wouldn’t kill myself because I owe it to my parents to outlive them. Fuck that. I won’t even make it to university. This is the third time I’m pulling an all-nighter this week to finish work and I haven’t even been fucking working for the last 6 hours. I don’t feel sad and I don’t even feel tired or numb. I know exactly what I feel. My will to die may finally have overpowered my crippling apathy. I’m not cut out for this world and I’d rather make my parents feel horrible guilt than face their disappointment when I become a useless, alcoholic basket case. Yes, I’m a fucking coward. A coward who has fought against his own mind for the better part of five years without any help. I can’t do it anymore. PS I’m not killing myself tonight, just sometime in the near future.",1
"I told him “no” and he got pissed. My uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and I told him no, I can’t take you right now. He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today. I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. Over the word no. He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out. Over the word no. But when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. My dad asked me the other day if I still had my “depression” What the fuck does he think? Edit thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I’m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don’t always fully understand where I’m coming from all of the time so it’s nice seeing that I’m not insane over denying someone else. I managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because I’m starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place I don’t want to be. Thanks again for taking the time to actually listen to what I’m saying.",1
"Need to put this into words I'm really struggling, and have been for a while. I've suffered on and off with depression for the better part of a decade and I'm now a 30 year old male, for reference. Over the past couple of years it's become a lot harder. My grandad passed away in 2019, with whom I was very close and saw a lot of. I still really miss him. With the advent of the pandemic, like many people I switched to working from home. I found the isolation hard, and the working environment more challenging. During this time, I left a team I was happy working with and made to join another area of the business at work. My struggles with my boss and her behaviour has made me really hate work. Work is always on my mind, I struggle to complete the things I need to do as I find it really hard to concentrate. My motivation just isn't there. It's not that I don't want to however or don't care; I then stress and worry about not performing well. It's really impacting my sleep and state of mind, and I'm so behind at work that it's causing problems. I've put on quite a lot of weight over the past year especially which also doesn't help how I feel. I'm bad for comfort eating when I'm feeling low, and that has taken its toll. I haven't said any of the above to anyone, not as it's written here, and I just needed to tell someone. Thank you.",1

"Are my parents toxic? Being an only child, my parents adored me when I was younger. They still do so I’m kinda spoilt I guess. I was sexually abused by my relative for three years when I was a child and I finally told my parents about this two weeks ago. They immediately told me to not tell anyone else about it and to not think much about what happened. It’s not that easy though. I’m getting therapy but I don’t know if I’ll ever be my old self again. To make things worse, they’re still friendly with that relative and just pretend like nothing happened. I don’t understand them at all. I’m still in college and very much dependant on them, so I can’t move out or anything. Should I just ignore what happened like it wasn’t a big deal? It took a lot of courage for me to open up to them and they just brushed it off like it was nothing.",1
"My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids. So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger. The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup. I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. EDIT She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition.",1

"Always stressed about assignments, please help So, I'm a college game development student who's just applied for uni and I've also had 3 different units to complete in the past 3 months. I was stressed over my personal statement and my unis of choice; and then even after sending the application, I got stressed over getting a reference and other details. There's also the fact my friend, who I joined this course with, said he won't be applying to uni so I will be all alone even if I do get in (I'm not good at being independent). I applied two weeks ago and yet I constantly stress over the idea of failing to get into uni just for small mistakes in assignments that have yet to be marked. The first unit one was due mid-November and I completed it but I'm stressed over the Harvard referencing because of the font, size and, to be completely honest, I don't know if I even referenced things right. I even noticed just now that in my project proposal, I gave the pathway for my last year course instead of the second year one so I'm scared but at the same time I've seen other proposals and they don't include the pathway so I'm unsure if I'm in the clear or not, ARRGH! The next unit is coming to a close (like a week) and I don't have any development to show for it but I have a ton of research. This is mostly due to it being a team-based unit and we have been unsure as to what we were actually supposed to be making until only a week ago since our tutors kept giving us mixed messages. Lockdown hasn't made anything any better either. We have to work at home now so our teams' communication has gone down the drain. The third unit has just started and it's going to be a specialised study unit which means a lot of it be just trying to find as much information about a couple of different artists. (I'm not too stressed about this unit since I excel at independent study). But it's also a matter of my FMP starting in a couple of weeks which will determine our end of year grade, which will most likely determine whether I get accepted into uni. I received a distinction last year in the first-year course, so all I need this year is to get a merit or higher. HOWEVER, if I only get a pass then I won't have enough tariff points for the uni courses I applied to! I'm incredibly overloaded with stress and I've never really learnt how to get rid of it since my mind is always on overclock just overthinking every minor thing! Please, someone, give me advice or tell me how to stop this...",1

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs. I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much. So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness.

Depression makes me SO boring Honestly I am so damn boring. Like.. its a main reason why I don't date anyone and never will. Its a reason why I have no friends and never will.

"School pressure I am currently doing A-levels and I am in my final year, in year 13. No matter what I do I cannot force myself to study. I can’t study more than five minutes because I just feel like crying whenever I study I don’t know what is wrong with me. I know and love education because I know it is the key to success and education is vital to life. I love the importance of it and know how privileged I am to receive an education. But somehow I cannot study and Do anything school related. I’m trying to talk to people around me about it but I just feel like crying because no one understands how I feel. I want to study but I can’t and every time I just feel like crying because I feel like I’m failing in my education. I am scared that if I feel I would let my family down. I think I may be scared of the idea of failing and letting my family down or it could be that school is sucking the fun out of education for me. Also, sometimes I feel like my education will go to waste because I am not allowed to work because I have to take care of someone and my dad brings the income. I feel like the main goal right now is to study and I’m failing because 1) I feel that I’m too scared to start studying because I will fail and 2) my education will go to waste as I’m not going to work due to other responsibilities so what is the point of studying? I’m not exactly sure what it is and my feelings are mixed. Sometimes I also worry about the future and think like if I feel my education and I am not working or doing anything I’m just at home feeling like a waste of space. I’m so confused. Can someone please help me out with suggest what I should do? Ps. Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense because I’m literally just feeling a mix of emotions and different things and it is just all a big mess.",1
I feel like I’m falling in a bottomless pit I’m currently 17 which I know is young but I just can’t seem to find any sort of hope for me to carry on and continue living. I feel as though I can’t catch a break it’s just continuous L after another like I’ve hit rock bottom but the ground gives way and I fall down even further. I used to get along with everyone but either the people I have trusted no longer want to talk to me or the friends I have now are just dickheads who make me feel like I’m not cared and that I’m a piece of shit but I only choose to hangout with them cause they are all they I have left in terms of people to talk to. Doesn’t help either that a girl I loved has abandoned me after telling her how I felt and whom I thought was the only person I could go to for help when I was down. She has made me more upset as she knew what I was going through with my depression and loneliness but she still left me. I’ve also had to give up some activities like my favourite sport baseball because I wasn’t mentally fit to play anymore and would have breakdowns on the bench or lash out at my teammates when they got on me for something because I didn’t do something right. Worst part is that when I left the team has played better without me making me feel even shittier than I was to begin with. I’m currently in therapy and am on meds but I can’t help about how I want to die so badly or harming myself whenever I get the chance. As someone who is in desperate need of help what would you do if you were me.,1
"Just paid off my $9k credit card balance I started 11 years ago! I had to share this because honestly what an incredible sense of relief!

"Having a bad day ? Ahh damnit it’s that day that comes now and then isn’t it ? Or that day that keeps coming every day and keeps you in bed ! Depression is very personal , you may be having a shit month because your sister died , your boyfriend of 7 years cheated on you , your cat was run over , your boss fired you and now you have to get rid of your car. Fuck sake , life is shit hey ! Why does everyone else have it so god damn easy ! Yes I know the Africans don’t have water but my pain is real and I can’t carry on ! I don’t want you to read this and carry on moping and feeling sorry for yourself , You are not a victim , get over it. As soon as you read this turn off your phone and embrace the open air and walk outside. I don’t care if your at work , it’s raining , you are somewhere important just do it. When you are outside slap yourself really hard on the face or ask someone to do it , feel some pain on your face , splash water in your face. You are not dead , you are still alive , very alive. Tomorrow can be shit , hell your dad died last week , maybe your mom will die tomorrow. BUT, tomorrow is a chance of not changing your life, like we are in some Hollywood movie , tomorrow is a chance maybe to have 1 smile , maybe a hug ? Maybe your friend might make you laugh on the phone. Depression is the inability to face our reality , we cannot face it and we therefore just shut off and wither until we end up slitting the wrist. Face it now and fight , depression is the hardest battle to face but the easiest to win , it’s just beating urself. You beat urself by letting go ( IM JUST SOME DICKHEAD ON THE INTERNET TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE , NOT MEDICAL ADVICE BUT I JUST LOVE PEOPLE red_heart )",1
"Feeling happy to have some close friends For as long as I can remember, I was always moving houses with my family, and when I moved houses I always had to make new friends. From the start to the end of my schooling I went to about eight schools so I was never there for too long. I always knew that going to a new school I would have fun and enjoy my time there, but in the back of my mind I had to remember that the people I know now may not always be there. I’m finally at a place where I have a good handful of close friends and I never thought I’d be there, its nice knowing that there is someone there just a message away and wanting to listen and have a chat.

Dealing with Anxiety at Work I’m a new lawyer and am constantly getting anxiety about making mistakes. The issue is that while I sometimes make mistakes I get anxiety about *possible* mistakes that I have no idea of verifying.

I can’t seem to enjoy life because this is all I think about. How can I escape this?,1
"How I overcame my pornography addiction & why I started to change my life for the better. This is tough for me to talk about but I thought this story will help inspire men. Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness! ",0

"What are my best options out of this burnout? Hi guys, Pretty sure I’ve got burnout and I’d live to know your thoughts on what’s some options to get out of this hole. I can’t even think straight so planning an exit route from this mess it’s proving hard. I’ll do a very brief overview of the situation. Male 39 3 months ago I was training for a ultra run. I’ve been very active all my life. Energy has never been an issue. During the training I started a new job after losing my previous job due to the pandemic. It’s been a massive step outside my comfort zone and I’ve been stressed almost daily for a few month now. The problem started after I did the ultra run. The week after I was tired as I expected but then it just kept getting worse and worse to the point I couldn’t even walk up stairs. Fast forward 3 months. I’ve not been able to do any exercise, my sleep is a mess, I have dry mouth all the time and I’ve got super bad brain fog. I don’t want to lose this job, it’s a serious career opportunity and could set me up for life and I don’t think it would be that hard if my brain was working properly. I should Mention that I’ve had my blood tested by the doctor and there was nothing wrong. I feel like I’m stuck In a cycle where I need to relax but my work is keeping me in a stressed state so I can’t relax and that means that my burnout is never going to go away. I do have holidays coming up, I’m just praying that my brain is going to reset itself but the same time I’m seriously worried that if I’m still knackered by the end of holiday which I think could be very possible then I’m going to go back into a busy year of work and I am never going to break out of this cycle. I’ve been living at home with my parents for the last year because I lost my previous job and I need to move out. I’m ready to buy house but I’m really struggling with the extra pressure of even looking for a house with the way my brain is at the moment. I know no job is worth giving yourself bad health but I don’t actually think it’s the job, I think that something has gone wrong with my body and the job is not helping but I don’t think necessarily that the job itself is what’s caused this, it’s a combination of maybe overtraining for running combined with the stress of the lockdown and not seeing anyone for year(my parents are isolating), ending of a big relationship I had previous and the work pressure, everything mixed into one somehow has just caused my body to to shut down. The question, How do I get out of this without losing my job? I’ve Been thinking maybe I need to go on medication to break the cycle of the stress so I can sleep better not be stressed every day at work and then my body will relax and reset. I know Antidepressants might be an option but I feel like they’re just a double edge sword/patch and I’ll just have a bunch of problems later on down the line to deal with coming off them. Would love to know Your thoughts on this situation, maybe you’ve been there and found a way back to full energy, thanks for your time",1
"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun.",1
"I'm stressed about my upcoming birthday I am a soon to be 14M who was born on the 25 of March. A few months back, y parents began asking what I want for my birthday. They offered hoodies, even 100 bucks. I declined, because I felt like if I responded, they would think I am some a-hole child who EXPECTS something for his birthday. Hence, I declined. But the sooner my birthday is approaching, the more stressed I get, because a few days ago, I finally realized what I wanted. This thing costs 36 bucks, but I need 50 bucks to purchase something that'll help me gain this thing. Thing is, I've already asked my mother if I could use my own money for this thing, and she said something like ""no, it's best to keep the cash for bad times, etc"" (referring to the recent pandemic). Another thing is that she has already lost one job due to the virus, and my dad isn't gaining much either. We are stabl3, we have good amounts of resources, and really everything is going just as it always has. But the problem is I feel selfish. I feel like they had already gotten something for me, and if I ask for money, they would have just already wasted it on something else they planned to give me. I feel like I should've came up with what I wanted earlier, before the pandemic and everything. I feel anxious whenever I ask for something, even though they want to give me something. Overall, I feel like an idiot and a selfish person. I can't even tell whether or not I should tell them what I want or not. I'm just worried over this thing that I reckon I'm over-thinking.

"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out? Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time.",1

"I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore. tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore",1

I hate watching scary movies but in the past I would get over them in about a day or so because the things in them were fake.

If you don’t know what it is, it’s about a cult. And it’s fucked up. That movie, I have not been able to get over and it’s been 4 days. It’s giving me anxiety. I keep thinking morbid things will happen to me or the people around me. I havnt been able to sleep with my door open or the lights off, my boyfriend has had to stay the night every night because otherwise I can’t sleep. I’m 23 years old and I work in an ER where I see actual injuries and people actually die and that doesn’t keep me up at night. But that movie has screwed with my head.

"For the first time in life, I’m confidently, madly in love with someone I’m madly in love It’s brought me to tears thinking about her and looking at her... Not a single person in my life has made me feel what she’s made me feel. It’s so overwhelming it leaves me speechless, not in any bad way, in a serene way that brings me peace. I love who she is, how she looks, how she expresses herself, how she thinks, her personality, how passionate she is about her interests, and how she treats me. I feel more valued, heard, safe, and appreciated than I ever have in my life. I want to grow with her and be there with her through the ups and downs of life. I want the best for her, and to be happy in life, and feel free to do whatever fulfills her. She’s strong enough to do anything and I want her to know that and conquer whatever faces her. I can tell her anything and she accepts it with an open heart. She enjoys taking care of me. She checks in and cares about my mental well being. She respects my boundaries strictly as I do hers, and we express them fully so each other understands. She makes me feel like the most important and beautiful person on earth...

"I’m the biggest disappointment in the world I hate myself for the following reasons I’m lazy, I don’t have a passion in life. My biggest fear in life is my parents hating me. Not in the sense that they kick me out and leave me homeless etc. that won’t happen. In the sense that they hate me as a person. I’m not like them, they do everything fast and quick, and do it well. My dad started from nothing and managed to give me a wonderful life. Me on the other hand, I had everything handed to me and I couldn’t do anything with it. I’m 20 and I hate myself. I wish I wanted to go to college, and if not, I wish I had some kind of talent so I could build my life around it. Sadly I don’t, there’s gonna be a day in my near future where my parents begin to look at me as the worlds biggest failure and that they regret having me or wish they had a kid who wasn’t useless. The bar was never set high for me, but I couldn’t even do the bare minimum. All I do is cry all day in my room but my parents haven’t noticed because I lock myself and I cry silently. I just need this feeling to go away. It’s so scary to think that life is just one big disappointment. Maybe I was wired this way or maybe I fucked it up.

"Gaming won’t distract me forever Lately I’m gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty. I guess it’s better than wallowing in my depression, but the minute I stop I’m back to suicide ideation.

I’m not eating, I’m not sleeping, I’m just exisiting at this point and not really living. I just think if I pull myself away from the screen I’ll give into the temptations that keep haunting me.

The amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible, thank you so much. I should’ve mentioned I do have a job, it’s a casual job but it pays the bills. And I also do have a therapist, who is also great but I at times feel like I shelter him from a lot of what’s been going on.

"How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives? I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that. The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. Anyone else feel this way? ",1
"Help] Stress/Anxiety is making me sick Hey r/Stress, I am not too sure if this is the correct place to post this, but give me a read and if its not I will find the correct place to go. A little background before I explain, I am a senior Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering student in the US getting ready to finish up the semester and get married, all within the next month. Here is the problem I am failing a class right now that would seriously hinder my future success if I do not pass \(my perspective, anyway\) and it is seriously hurting my productivity. I am sick to my stomach \~70% of the time , cannot sleep on a beneficial schedule, and am finding myself with no discipline/motivation for anything. The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health. I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants.",1

"I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering. Why does this happen to me. Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what. Edit half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed face_with_rolling_eyes he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help. Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading.

"What are some of the consequences to telling people that I am potentially suicidal? I'm tempted to start opening up this part of myself to my friends and I'm wondering if anyone else has done this and what the impact was for those relationships. Something that bothers me in daily living is that I feel constrained and I feel like I'm always keeping part of myself hidden. I'm thinking that sharing that part of my identity will help me feel more open and expressive. I want people to understand and accept that I'm not happy and I'm tired of pretending that everything is going to work out and get better. I'm 32. One positive thing that's happened so far is that when you tell people you don't want to live they might share with you their reasons for living. That perspective can be helpful. And a note that I am seeing a therapist and I'm not going to kill myself today. I'm just wanting to tell people how I feel about living, so I can feel understood? Idk. Don't want to frighten anyone..",1

"The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date. It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person. When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel. edit Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better.",1
"Stressed and feel like I don’t have anyone to turn to I like my work, I like what I do. But I’m also overwhelmed. I have double the work of my coworkers, because I’m very good at my job. But it’s frustrating because I’m a bit behind on the files (about a week and a half behind now), and continue to get more behind as more and more are assigned to me. And then one of my coworkers was able to have a full hour person phone call because of the free time he has. It’s frustrating. I’m also in grad school, and took 2 courses during summer so I just don’t have the time to work OT and get caught up. I also cry sometimes when I get overly stressed. I also have a few diagnoses (bipolar 2, adhd, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder), which I’m still in the process of finding the right mix of meds. There was short period of time where I cried at least once a week. The first time my boss had been around when I cried she made me feel like I was too weak to handle the job. But continued to assign me files. Since then I have avoided crying when she’s in the office. I was talking to my bf tonight. Kept talking over me, and would barely let me get a sentence out. And when I raised my voice to tell him he was talking over me he diverted the conversation to me yelling at him instead of acknowledging he was talking over me. He said he wasn’t talking over me. And then called me weak because I cry from work. I can’t talk to my friends about it, because my boss is part of the friend group so I don’t want her to think I’m still weak. I have a tendency to change jobs every year and a half so I’m not trying to do that again. I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading.",1
"High School... Hi, I searched for many subreddits to let out my feelings and I felt like this was the most appropriate. I am currently a senior in high school and worked through an enormous amount of stress and hardwork for the last 3 years. I took 12 AP and honors classes, was captain of the robotics team, on student council, and much more. There were many many days when i stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning studying for tests, getting stressed out about grades, teachers overloading us with home work, trying to make my parents proud, and more importantly myself proud. I went into this school year a happy dude, just finished 3 hardworking stressful years of high school and hope to get into at least 1 college that I wanted. 2 weeks ago I learned that i got denied to every college I wanted to go to except 1 and I got waitlisted/deferred. These past two weeks I have felt useless, depressed, and most of all stressed out. I have had this feeling in my head that just makes me feel like im about to pass out. I have felt like there was basically there was no point in doing anything anymore. I have just been going through the motions of life, on the outside looking happy, on the inside just stressed out of my mind. I thought I experienced stress before, but nothing is like this. I've tried so many ways of relaxing but everything just makes me so stressed. I sure as hell don't want pity and I'm not making excuses, I just needed to let it all out, I didn't really know what to do. My parents don't really care that i'm stressed, they just tell me that ""There is no reason to be stressed"". I think thats what makes me stressed more than anything, the fact that I go to my parents and think they tell me that I can just turn it off like it has an off switch. I just needed somewhere to let it out.",1

I won't miss you or everything you've put me through.. Now it's my time to speak my mind, and I'll be just fine.. So here and now I'll tell you the truth.. I say goodbye to you",1
"Bouts so lowness It feels like I'm just holding on to these different parts of me that if I don't, will just crumble into a meaningless heap of nothing. I've lost my friends over me being distant. My boyfriend was my only real connection w others, but he's leaving too because of long dist issues. Life just feels... unbearable at times. I want to get through this, I want to party, I want to be happy - but mostly, I just want to feel like myself again. What do I do when I just can't be by myself, but I'm all alone? The anxiety is killing me.",1
"Just want it to be over I just want to die. I feel incapable of achieving my own goals, dreams or anything at all. I feel awkward while I’m around other people even my friends, it’s also hard for me to talk to them. I feel incapable of expressing my own thoughts. And I feel lonely and like some useless piece of shit. I just want to end my pain and my lonely awkward existence should go with it.",1

"Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person. Spooky.",1

"Effervescent magnesium helped a lot I have been burned out from work stress and feeling terribly numb for months. I started having a magnesium effervescent whenever I feel stressed, anxious, sad or numb- it's helped so much. I feel a difference within an hour of taking it and it continues to keep those feelings away for a full day. Today, I even felt like doing a small bit of exercise. I tried the multivitamins with magnesium and the magnesium supplements but nothing helped as much as this. I hope this information helps you.",1
"I stayed up all night talking with the most amazing woman. I just stayed up all night talking to a woman who is genuinely interested in me. We stayed up talking about music and nerdy things like DnD, she laughed at all my stupid jokes, and was fully invested in everything I had to say, as well as having her own thoughts on whatever the subject may be. after I thought we were done talking and i was ready to sleep she called me back and we talked for another hour, it felt like minutes. I haven't felt like this in a very long time. Especially while sober. Fingers crossed everything works out. (Sorry for bad English/grammer.)",0
"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that” Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. ",1
"I wake up with nausea every day from stress and want to stop Every morning I wake up and my stomach hurts from stress (I have a problem that I can’t seem to solve no matter what I’ve tried so far, been going on for almost 2 years) and I want to just stop thinking about the problem and stop worrying about it but I can’t even subconsciously I guess if I’m trying to focus on something else, and I spent half my day just trying to force myself to eat food and calm my stomach and it’s making me suicidal along with other things. Wondering if anyone has any tips or strategy for calming nausea caused by stress (I saw a doctor about my stomach issues and it’s clearly just stress)",1

Some thoughts I’ve suffered from depression for about 3 yrs now and I genuinely want to die but the only reason holding me back is because I don’t want my family to fall apart.

"So I bought myself flowers today. No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch. EDIT Wow ) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today )",0

Easily stressed So I get stressed quite easily and find it difficult to cope with pressure and difficult situations. I also find that when such stressful situations happen I tend to blame myself for them and get really down and negative about myself. I get quite worked up about it that sometimes end up having mental breakdowns and let it all out by having a good cry. I don’t know what to do to be more resilient and deal with it better so it doesn’t affect me so much because it’s affecting my mental health and making me feel worse about myself.,1
"I'm getting more and more stupid. For a while now I feel like I am getting progressively stupid. Information doesn't stick, common sense doesn't kick in and overall I really struggle following conversations and responding correctly. I'm always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things I've said, things I should of said, how slowly I've been to react to something and overall how useless I am. I feel like I'm turning into a sloth. My body is so heavy and every now and then I have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on because I've blinked and ten minutes has gone by. I don't recognise this mess that I've become and I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it? I'm miserable and what's worse I'm frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless. Help disappointed_face ",1
"Everyone is struggling in life, and I'm not even trying. Without getting in too much detail, I crossed paths with an orphan kid who moved to the city to take a chance on himself despite his very bad situation. Meanwhile?

"I want to die but I don't want to die. Can anyone else relate to this? Every day plays out the same way. Bored out of my mind, extremely unmotivated to do anything. I'm sure that if I keep going forward, I may reach something that may make me happy eventually. But that would take so much work, way too much for me. How could someone like me achieve something so big, when I get tired just from performing tasks required to live? I am almost tired 24/7. Wake up, get out of bed, eat food, maybe take a shower. Ok, I've had enough for the day already. I've already realized that in the end, anything that I accomplish in life won't mean anything. When I die, everything that I did in my life won't matter anymore. It might matter to the people that were entangled in my timeline, but eventually they will figure out the same thing, so it's fine, they will stop caring as well. Wherever darkness manifests itself, there is still light. I still want to enjoy my life here on earth, and in fact, I do sometimes. I still really care about the people close to me. The feeling of love is what stops me from ending it. I wish that I didn't have to feel this way, but I'm still a human. It pains me that some people care about me, because they really shouldn't. If they knew how I felt, I'm sure it would pain them. I wish others didn't need to feel pain. I know that this is definitely not normal, but sometimes I feel that my goal is to save everyone from this inevitable suffering. I doubt it will happen, but some day I think that I would like to build some crazy powerful atomic bomb and destroy earth so us humans would no longer have to feel anything anymore. I want to die, but I don't want to die yet.",1
Does anyone experience this? I’ve been through a lot of stress lately and I’ve gotten many anxiety attacks. My back and abdomen randomly hurt and sometimes my left breast area.

Alcohol… Alcohol is the only relief I can get guys. I was binging drinking 3 years ago and then I got roofied which made me stop. So I stopped drinking for 5 months and then began drinking every once in awhile. Lately I tried weed/exercise/work/etc to switch up a healthy life choice but I keep finding myself going back to at least a few shots every weekend to find some relief in my life. I deal with depression and it just gets hard. Why is alcohol such a comfort….,1

"Mind is racing and I can't stop over thinking everything, feeling in despair about everyone and everything. I've been unemployed for a year after working in a highly stressful job and at the same time coming to terms that I was diagnosed with anxiety/depression in the midst of it all and figuring out I've had it since I was 13 but never acknowledged or understood why I felt like a outsider 247. I tend to push people I care about away when I want time to myself even though I hate the distance, I don't mean to but I do because I over think everything and my anxiety creates things that aren't even there then it manifests into something that is on loop until I just keep sinking and on top of that the depression really just sends me to such a irrational, overly emotional and unstable person that can't contain my thoughts and I just completely spiral till I feel so hopeless that I just lay there and cry in frustration. This week has really been tough and I don't know who to invest in, my best friend who knows about my depression is always there for me but he has found some new friends which I think has triggered me to believe that just like some of my other friends he will just forget about me and decide its all too hard, I think that's what I fear because then I will be completely alone and it's like losing the light in this dark room that keeps me a float. Sorry if this is really long, it took me 40 minutes to type that as my brain is a scattered mess, I tried putting it the best way that I could as it feels like I'm multitasking 6 things at once. If somebody could please help me or give me suggestions on managing things at least I'd be forever grateful as I am losing myself completely",1

"Struggling with my past… I’m really down right now. Coming to terms with my past and how I’ve acted. Self awareness and warranted self-judgment. Pain. Emptiness. I’m also struggling with loss and loneliness. I lost my grandmother and father last year. I’m trying to ignore those. The more pressing depression…The woman I wanted to marry broke up with me nearly 4 years ago, after an amazing 5 year relationship. She told me she never loved me at the end of the relationship… i loved her so much. I wanted her to love me. I hate this. I just want to be happy. I just want to sleep forever. I feel like I’m not strong enough to wake up and deal with these same emotions, these same feelings, and these same broken patterns over and over. My father was fucked, and I’m fucked in the same ways and more. I struggle with the thought of how I’ve been a ‘simp’ in the past. I mean, I fucking loved her. I don’t know what I can do to be happy when my concept of happiness was centered around her. I want to die. I wanted to be happy. I wanted to make her happy. I tried, but it didn’t work. So I’ve spent the last 4 years trying to understand why she wasn’t happy with me. Now I get it, and it hurts even more. Just want some encouragement. I hate myself so much. I don’t know what to do or how to help myself. I thought if I understood her, I would be better. I just agree with her now. I don’t want to change. I am so lonely. I just want to stop hurting.",1

"First time writing my thoughts down. Observations that make me depressed 1. I feel like no one is like me. 2. Time ends all. 3. Shitty people own the world. 4. Life has no meaning. (Unless you like lying to yourself) 5. Everyone is clueless, including me. 6. Laughing is my only escape. 7. Love doesn’t happen to everyone. (it should) 8. Nothing amazing ever happens. 9. Everyone has a demon they can't escape. 10. Most people don’t help, only hate. (My observations) 11. I got lucky with my life compared to most people, and that bothers the fuck out of me. 12. Am I the only one that thinks this way? I feel like a crazy person, no one ever talks about this shit. 13. Critical thinking is rare. (Should be standard in 2021) 14. Death sounds fun compared to living since its something no one knows about. 15. I wish I didn’t exist, yet I love who I am compared to everyone else. 16. I lie to myself to feel better, but it always fades at the end of the day. I wrote this list for me, but if it resonates with anyone else then that makes me slightly happy. I have been alone with my thoughts of what this world I live in is about for so long, and nothing makes sense. I just want answers that no one has, and it has been eating away at me for years. Everyone tells me to not think about it, and just live your life. I cant, these questions and observations that I always come back to is all I care about. They are the only questions that need an answer... Who gives a fuck about what to have for lunch when you don’t even know why you exist? I would be fine if I lived in a utopia of magic and wonder, but that is a fantasy that does not exist. I am living in hell that others see as normal.",1
"I’m really losing it, and I can’t afford therapy right now Sorry if this is long. I genuinely have no one else to talk to, and I’ve never opened up to anyone about this. My parents are also between jobs so they neither have the insurance nor the money to afford a therapist. I’m 22 years old, in my last year of my doctorate (I skipped many grades), and I’ve even passed difficult international business exams recently. But life just hurts. I feel like I’ve always pushed myself beyond limits because if I stop, I’ll go back to wanting to kill myself. I have ‘friends,’ but for the last 7 years I’ve always had to pretend to be happy, so none of them really know me. I’ve always been the one person in the room who was just never having fun, always wanting to go back home, crawl in my bed, and have dark fantasies about being hurt enough to finally make the ultimate decision. I can’t open up to anyone because no one knows how to react to my depression, let alone my suicidal mindset. I’ve tried some meds for a month, and it helps slightly, but I’m so ashamed of taking them. I haven’t refilled my prescription, and I don’t intend to. I refuse to be dependent and weak. I’m writing because after several years, I’ve noticed behaviors in me I never had before. 2 months ago I had something hurtful happen to me socially, and since then I’ve been hitting myself and screaming “FUCK YOU” to myself when I’m driving with my thoughts. I have no energy, but I keep working. My efficiency is only 1/3 of what it should be, but it’s the most I can do to keep going. I’m tired. Even if I could afford therapy, if I tell my therapist that I’m really suicidal at times, I’ll be forcefully admitted into a hospital and my doctorate will be postponed by a year (if that happens I’ll be extremely suicidal). There’s nothing wrong with me physically. I’m average height, no deformities, no issues regarding intelligence. I’m okay… yet I still just want to end things. I also believe it’s absolutely unfair for someone to be in a relationship with me. How could I burden anyone with this. I can’t share this pain, because it’s horrible, and no one should have to deal with this. Not that most girls would anyway. How long could someone realistically stay and help someone who’s self esteem is shattered and can’t ever open up but looks extremely depressed. Anyway, just wanted to let this out anonymously somewhere. Thanks.",1

Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down. Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day.

"What's going on with me? I was diagnosed with depression about 3 months ago. But recently, about a months ago, I went from being just normal to literally yelling at my dad ""I'm amazing, idgaf what you do to me"" And I was really, genuinely, doing AMAZING. I was really cocky, I wasn't taking my pills (I know that sounds dumb but it was making me feel worse. I felt like I was on top of the world and these pills stabilized me), and everyone who was close to me was saying I was acting off. Even though inside I was doing AMAZING, and I felt like I climbed a mountain. I also couldn't really sleep, I slept for about 4 or 5 hours at most for this little period. I also felt like these random thoughts coming all over the place were coming to me through God. I went through my memory and realized this happened alot to me at all kinds of points in my life. It happened when I was about 11, and looking back I was definitely acting like a huge dick. I screamed at my friends that I'm amazing, they're worse than me blah blah. So they all stopped talking to me because I'm my eyes I was like Jesus. Spreading my truth and trying to show everyone the world I live in. I also couldn't sleep during this time. I honestly don't know if this Is a symptom of Depression or if I'm just a dick at heart but I find this really really weird, and for the first time I noticed this is actually a problem. I went from feeling GREAT, to feeling so depressed and suicidal in one month. I honestly don't know what's going on with me but I really need advice for this. I got a doctor's appointment just tomorrow so of course I'm going to tell them about this but I also want other people who have depression to put on their view on it.",1

"Stressed About Making Mistakes at Work Hi, I’m working on commercial ships as 3rd mate and I’m extremely scared of making any mistakes at work. We are usually making long contracts, 4-7 months (without internet and without seeing your family, friends etc at all) and I’m keeping watch 8-12 am and pm 8 hours a day, every single day. Even sundays. +overtime. During my watch I’m really scared especially in high traffic areas when some people don’t follow the collision regulations (colreg rules) and making absurd turns. I had few close quarter situations. Please not that if you have a collision most likely you and everyone in the ship (around 25ppl) are going to die. Also about the paper work, if you make even a smallest spelling mistake, countries may charge up to 15.000$ per mistake. For an example, you are going to China and it has special rules. When you are making a crew list, instead of writing everyone’s name according to passport, they want Ukrainian people’s seaman’s book name instead. (And yea names are different in seaman’s book and passport for some people) Sometimes we do 5 ports in a week and whatever rules and agreements say, it’s very common to sleep around 30-40 hours a WEEK. How can I overcome this fears? I double/triple check everything but still I never feel comfortable and always stressed all the time. Waiting for your comments.

"I’m Quarantined Away From My Baby and My Boyfriend Is No Help Info BF has manic depression (it’s what he calls his diagnosis. I’m aware that it’s called bipolar disorder now but, I’m respecting his label for his own mental health disorder.) He’s on meds that he takes off an on because his sleep schedule is messed up due to a new job and he’s supposed to take them every 24 hours before bed. He’s been off of them for 3 day. I feel like he is acting like this because he is off his meds. I have depression, anxiety and, PTSD. I’m on Zoloft, buspar and, the mini pill. I’m currently off of the Zoloft and buspar due to all of my life changes which has amped up my depression and PTSD symptoms. I’ve run out of my mini pill which helps with anxiety so I imagine that will get worse if I can’t get a refill soon. Actual Post Hey. I have to quarantine away from my baby because I’m really sick and my partner tested positive. I’m really depressed about it and idk what to do to stop crying. I’ve been crying for 2 days. I feel so empty without her. She’s getting over RSV and has an ear infection in both ears so it’s better for her to be at her father’s away from me but, every instinct in my body is screaming to have her safe in my arms. I just can’t stop crying. I already have depression anxiety and ptsd and I think that this is feeding into those. Im off my meds rn because my hospital sold my doctor’s practice plus I moved to a new county so I have to find a new doctor to get the right meds. Now that’ll have to wait for this quarantine. I didn’t hug her enough before she left with him. I was sick and it hurt to be touched and I just didn’t snuggle her enough. She looked at me through FaceTime yesterday and cried wanting me. She just kept reaching for me through the phone and didn’t understand why I couldn’t hold her. Im also dealing with jealousy because my ex’s new girlfriend is seeing her everyday and getting to love on her and hold her and play with her. I know that it’s selfish but, this girl wants to be a mother badly and it feels as if she’s stealing my baby. I know that she’s not stealing her but, it feels that way. I just want her home. How am I supposed to do 10 days of this? How am I supposed to go from seeing holding her and loving on her everyday to not at all. This is so hard. My boyfriend has 3 kids that he’s across the country from so, he’s desensitized to it. For him it’s been his life for 2 years so he doesn’t understand why it’s such a big deal. He just wants me to magically get better. He has his own depression and says that it’s not good for him to be around someone so depressed, which is valid but, it still hurts to hear. He says that I need to work harder to fix it. He says that I’m not working hard enough. Idk what he wants me to do in isolation that I haven’t been doing for years already. I’ve been suicidally depressed since I was a little girl due to be in an abusive home. I’ve been to numerous healthcare professionals and on multiple meds and combinations of meds for years. It isn’t an overnight fix and I don’t think that he understands that. He wants me to reach out to people around me and people on Facebook and stuff but, I don’t talk about my mental health issues with people. When I’ve tried in the past people just treated me like I was crazy or expected it to be fixed overnight or very quickly blamed every little thing they didn’t like about me on my mental illnesses and then dumped me because of them. I became stigmatized very quickly and I hated it. It’s embarrassing to talk about in general. A lot of people depend on me and this shows me as being a undependable person. That’s how I get treated when I mention it at least. He openly talks about his mental health to anyone who listens and I worry that he burdens others with it and I don’t want to burden others too. That gets exhausting for people very quickly. He said that reaching out like that is what will fix it quicker though. Idk why I’m just an object to be fixed to him. When he keeps asking how we can fix it I just want to scream. Like, am I not allowed to just feel it for a second? Can I not just be sad for a couple days then move on from it and that be okay? Why is it wrong for me to just cope with it in my own way? He asked for me to be more emotional. I’m usually a very logical person as a defense mechanism to hide this part of myself and protect it. I don’t show emotions to anyone. He asked me to because he hated that logical defense mechanism. He broke those walls down. I warned him about this multiple times. He said that he could handle it. Now, every time I have any emotion whether it’s excitement, happiness, anger or, depression, he says that it’s too much for him to handle. He distances himself from me. I tried to express that to him and he actively denied doing it. He said that he’s just communicating. It’s great that he is but he’s confirming that I am a burden by doing that. Why ask me to be emotional if you can’t take those emotions on? Why offer support only to wrench it away so suddenly when I need it most? He’s so supportive and loving with all of his friends and takes every emotion of theirs in stride with his own. He sometimes puts me on the back burner to do so. Why can he do that with them but, not me? Why can he just so readily be there like he promised without trying to just fix everything but, not do that for me? Why am I just something to be fixed? Why am I the one that’s too much for him? He says that I’m sad all the time. I pointed out that the majority of time that I’m chipper and happy and high energy and he hates that. He says that it’s too much which forces me to either be neutral or have a negative emotion. He just brushed by that statement and never addressed it. Like, what does he want from me here? I feel like I can’t win. I’m just struggling and need someone and he promised to be that someone and now it feels like he’s dropped me in an ocean after trying to rescue me from it and I’m drowning. I want to go back to not feeling but, he hates that too. I asked him what the point of me being here is then. I asked him what I do for him. He says that I give him something to look forward to when he wakes up in the morning. Idk what to do with that. It makes me feel like a warm body to just fill space. He says that he isn’t ready to go full on commitment and be super serious but, we’ve moved in together in his place because he thought that it’d be a good idea. We said I love you only for him to recently admit that he said that out of an intimate love for me but, he isn’t in love with me. He doesn’t want to be serious but then he keeps trying to break down my walls and expects me to just pour all of my emotions out to him even though he can’t handle it. He doesn’t want anything but also wants everything and I’m going through emotional whiplash. Idk how this turned into a rant about him. I just. I’m depressed and I’m not doing good and he is my one form of support and I’ve lost it. I just want my daughter home and in my arms. I guess that this whole thing is just a rant. I’m just gonna walk back inside with a fake smile on my face I guess so that he can think that I’m magically better. What’s ironic is he told me to open up to people and that my fears of what they’ll do is just stigma and unfounded but, he’s doing the exact thing that I was scared of this entire time. He essentially proved me right. I’m all alone and no one will ever be able to help me. Thanks for reading. If you have any tips for getting out of this depressive rut until I can get a new psychologist and new meds you’d be my knights in shining armor. Rn I’m on Zoloft and buspar at the highest doses but they make me feel drunk and I can’t take those while caring for a daughter even though they do work outside of that. If you have any medication recommendations as well, I’d love to hear them. Thanks again.",1
"A stranger on the beach just gave me money to buy ice creams for the group of young people I was with and walked away I'm an Italian volounteer working in France for an association that helps young people without family to get indipendent. They're mostly migrants from Africa and Arab countries that need housing, getting regular documents to legally stay in the country, finish their studies and find a work. Due to Covid we didn't do many activities and we were left with some extra budget, so we decided to spend it for a trip, and yesterday we brought them to the beach. We were a dozen seven teenagers from several african countries, three from Pakistan, me, and an educator. As soon as we arrived we immediately went into the water. Me, being a little thin and suffering the cold from the water more than other people, got out earlier than the others and went back where we left our stuff. Not a minute after I got there, a guy came to me asking something. It went like that Him Are you supervising that group there? (pointing at my young ones playing in the water) Me Yes At that point I expected some kind of bad remark. And instead. Him We are leaving tomorrow, and I wanted to give you this to spend for getting them ice creams And he lent me a 50 euros banknote. I didn't really know what to reply on the spot, and just told him a ""thank you"", very surprised. He didn't wait for more, and just left. He had his towel a little further, he packed his stuff, was joined by who I guess were his wife and daughter, and went away. He didn't ask if I was working for some association, who the young ones I was supervising were, nothing. He didn't even wait for giving the money when everyone was present. He just made this selfless act and departed. On the way back we bought everyone ice creams and I ended the day with a really great feeling. I think it was the nicest, most spontaneous thing I ever happened to see from someone.",0
"I am a 15 year old boy who has finally found what true happiness is. In the last year I have found some of the best friends I think I will ever make. I was in a very dark place when someone I hurt badly convinced me to change. I tried my best and in the last year of changing myself and the friendgroup gaining more people I have never been so happy with life. I have my bad days but I know there are always people to help me. I started working out, I got back into drumming. There is a girl I still like that is in the friend group and yet even though she doesn’t feel the same way, her support through my depression has been overwhelming and she has truly showed me what it means to love. Thanks for listening to my random rant lol I just wanted to express how good I’ve been feeling.",0

Anyway I'm really really behind class for this particular module. I messaged my lecturer if she could send me the notes so I can figure out the work myself, and she didn't even bother to open my message though she was online so many times grinning_face_with_big_eyes and now I'm just like, do I still fucking go to class? Because it's online, so she's probably gonna confront me in front of everyone and ask me why the fuck I haven't even started on anything when everybody else is completely done with their work. Oh also I don't speak to anyone, except for 1 but they probably annoyed at me so yeah I really have no idea what's going on anymore and uh I don't wanna risk getting yelled at in front of everyone like wtf but if I skip I have to keep skipping so I guess I should just attend but I feel so uneasy like why can't she just reply me",1

"Condemned The clock is moving too fast, I am young but I feel old, very old. I destroy everything that I touch and do nothing very constructive. I have someone I share my life with who has difficulty understanding how I may be feeling and I feel guilty. I feel guilty for making her go through all these shitty times and making her life hell. I live badly with it, sometimes i'm even having delusions about saving my loved ones. I'm afraid to come out of my depressed nest, let's say; to find job or friends or even a simple feeling of normalcy would bring me satisfaction and ultimately be wrong. It would be the straw that broke the camel's back. I imagine that I will have to learn to live with these conditions all my life. From the bottom of my heart thank you.",1
"Does anyone else kind of fantasize about killing themselves when they get really stressed? So I'm really not a depressed person at all, probably more the opposite, but when I am in a really stressful situation at work (especially when I mess something up) I honestly feel like killing myself. I wouldn't do it because I have a wife and kids, but can anyone relate to this feeling? It's especially strong when I feel like I'm not good at my job.",1

My parents even told me they had almost no hope for me and didn't think I'd make anything of myself. I have done well enough in 10 years that I'll never be forced to work again unless I decide I want to. I have no idea how I even managed that as it was never my intention. I looked in the mirror this morning and couldn't stop smiling. I feel so blessed and am so proud of myself for never letting anyone stop me or hold me back. I'm so happy.",0
"Acknowledge the building stressors in your life. As you age, there will be more and more stress. Learn about this before it's too late...!! I am in my early 30's. I just had a birthday of a significant number to me. I had a crisis. I'm still recovering from it. Life is getting more and more and more stressful. I've had the same job for 6 years, and it's increasing, too, and my workload is starting to get to me. I've lost the ability to relax so it's hard to distract myself in the evenings. We recently moved into a bigger house with roommates, so there's more responsibility there. You might notice that your functioning breaks down. It becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary. Might even be hard to eat. That's ""Burn Out"". It's a terrible place to be, and it just gets worse. If you have a mental disorder like me, then stress will hit you harder (""I'm working to collect all of them!"" is what I joke to my friends in a ""maybe-I'm-being-serious"" kind of way...). If you have a mental disorder like me, it'll be hard to regulate stress. Your mind wants to go at its own pace, and there's a pace forced upon you that your mind doesn't like to follow. But in order to survive you must follow it. You need to find your own pace, and go at that pace as much as freaking possible. I've realized, on that birthday mentioned above, that it's damn hard to re-discover your own pace when you've become so used to existing in overwhelming stress. ... we become zombies on auto-pilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment. We lose connection with life, existing merely as creatures of survival. This can change, but it is also very hard. Therapy helps. Medication can help. Routine helps – create whatever patterns you can that re-instill a passion for life. Patterns and routines make you feel in control – you are in control, but control is hard to work up to. I'm working up to it. I feel weak but I'm so damn strong for making it this far, and so are you. ",1
"I’m not mentally stable I don’t know what it is, but my feelings always get disregarded, I haven’t had a reason for being alive for a while now, even after I had my son, i fell into the gang life even tho they’ve been trying to kill me since before I was official, I’ve tried to kill myself multiple times before and I don’t understand why I’m so emotional I’m a guy lmao my feelings always get disregarded from everyone, my mom used to tell me I have no reason of being depressed, the same person who got me locked up when I was 15-16, I don’t understand people have kids and feel joy to know their child is in this world, that gives them automatic joy, that shit didn’t even fully effect me bro, I think of him and I feel temporary joy, no matter the situation, I feel temporary joy, this sounds so fucked up but the only time I felt genuinely happy was when I met the female who is now my girlfriend. But I fuck up a lot. I assume a lot. And she doesn’t fully trust me either. Honestly idk what’s wrong with me, I know I shouldn’t depend on no one for love. I haven’t loved myself in years. I only feel joy when I play video games. I only feel like the world isn’t crashing down on me and I should end it when i play video games and that sounds sooooo fuckin stupid. I sound so fucking stupid. My sister is the only one who knew I tried to kill myself before for real, everyone else treated it like it was a joke, then 2 weeks later it didn’t really matter. My life is a joke. Everything fucked up. I had something going for myself which wasn’t legal. And I fucked it up. I am not selfish. I go out of my way for the people I love. And it doesn’t seem to matter. I don’t seem to matter. No one realizes that I don’t leave my room during the day and that I’m in bed all day. I’m skinny as fuck. I am so depressed. Honestly I cant handle it. I just want to end it. I found god recently there’s no doubt that he’s real to me from the things that happened. Too many coincidences can’t be a coincidence, I hate myself. I did things that I can’t take back to people and they’ll never forget it. I feel like hitting them up so bad to the point that the message is typed so they can come end me. My heart is broken. Everyone I felt genuinely close to died on me. One got killed, the other two died in an accident. The only people who truly understood me. I feel so broken. I cant take life anymore and if anyone sees this and replies if I don’t reply I’m sorry. I just couldn’t take it. I cant handle my life. I hate myself so much. I hate myself so much and it shows. I’m not a bad person I go out of my way for the people I love that’s why my true friends always tell me they love me. But I can see they don’t truly care. No one truly cares. I’m going to see my brother right now cause I feel like that’s the person I’m closest to at the moment. I’m sorry this is so long. And I’m sorry I’m advance if I’m not here to see any replies. I cant handle my pain. My depression is getting the best of me. I’m broken and I don’t think I can’t be fixed. I know they won’t see this but I’m sorry to my family I’m sorry to my sisters who I was so close with and I don’t even talk to any more, I’m sorry to my mom who I know loves me but doesn’t really show it. I’m sorry to everyone that cares about me but I can’t handle my life. I feel like everything will be over soon. I love all my family all my siblings my nieces my nephews and I love my son with all my heart. He has a great father figure in his life right now and I’m sure he will take good care of him. I’m sorry I couldn’t be what everyone wanted me to be. I’m sorry my decisions and the things I say just bring people pain. I’m sorry I’m like this.",1
"So much stress from work... The bad dreams and restless nights are returning. Like many others in here, I work in a stressful position. I help clients with our accounting software. It's been very busy with the holidays and everyone trying to get ready for end of the year stuff. I have to meet tight deadlines and assist people that don't know what they're doing. As mentioned, it's been very busy. I was able to keep up but now I'm falling behind. Im not the only one. When I do call our customers they are usually shitty because of our slow customer service. I had a guy that I was trying to help. He gave me the wrong information, it turned a 15 minute phone call into something that spanned over 3 days. My boss told me to say something when I get behind. But that usually happens very fast. The boss checks in on me when I'm having a shit day. With the check ins, I get criticized for being behind and not saying anything. This time around, I was doing alright but had about four days where I had cases that needed to be resolved right away. Our company gives us a half day off on Fridays to help with Covid stress. I just had one. Those days, I have half a day to get done with a full day work load. This job had made me want to walk out. I was urged by my partner to stay. This lead to multiple anxiety attacks. I admitted defeat and was going to quit again. I was encouraged to get on medication, which has helped with the anxiety and some other issues. However, it's getting to the point again where I'm stressing out. My partner has only suggested to get on a higher dose of medication. Im not sure how much stress can be medicated away. I'm getting to my wits end. Finally I have some vacation days coming. I'm going to use those to look for another job. Hopefully I can find something.",1
"hi, i don’t want to live and i want help this is my second post here, and this might be kinda long because there’s a lot to get off my chest, but recently i’ve broke up with my girlfriend about a week ago due to falling out of love with her out of the blue (admittedly we’d been arguing quite a bit but it wasn’t anything too crazy, i just felt kinda emotionally drained), and i just haven’t been able to get attracted to any other girl since this. i’ve always been into women my whole life, obsessed over them in school and would be on my mind 24/7, naturally after feeling like this for the first time i’ve questioned whether maybe i’m gay/bi, and i don’t seem too into men, although i also have an extremely low sex drive rn so i guess it’s kinda hard to tell whether i’m into gay stuff or men now or not, but basically i just want to die because everything was going perfect with this girl, and now i’m either not attracted to anyone or i’m gay, either way my life is completely ruined and i feel like there’s nothing to live for anymore. if i’m gay or asexual i’m just not the same person anymore and my whole life plans are gone, idk what to do, every day i’m stressing about whether i’m attracted to women still or whether i’m attracted to men now, so my sex drives low from all the anxiety and sadness i’ve been dealing with, but i can’t raise my sex drive because my anxiety won’t go away about what’s going on with my sexual preferences etc etc has anyone else gone through something similar or have any ideas on what to do?",1

"I feel like I have lost all my skills I dont know how to describe it but I have a crippling depression for a year now, and the most noticable thing, aside from being sad and suffocated all the time, is the gradual loss of my skills in all areas of life.

Sometimes when I talk my mind suddenly blacks out and I have no idea what to say next, or totally forget what should I say. I struggle with basic math problems. I feel like I have lost all my critical abilities, I do not really have an opinion about anything or any belief towards a certain thing, I dont go into discussions anymore because I know very well that my mind does not work well and will struggle after a sentence or two.

"How to survive Christmas?! Sorry in advance for any mistakes, English is not my first language! For as long as I can remember Christmas has always been a time of very intense feelings for me. I've always felt the Christmas holidays to be an overwhelming and stressful period of time, basically the exact opposite of what holidays are supposed to be like. My parents also reinforced this by making the Christmas stuff last for days. By this I do not only mean the actual celebration, but also the seemingly endless time you have to spend with the same people over and over again, including the same old political arguments and the forced gatherings of relatives you literally NEVER (have to) see except for this time of the year. Even without all this family stress, Christmas itself, the beginning of a new year and also my birthday (also happening at the beginning of January) are times, when I feel low no matter what happens. I always feel like I haven't even nearly accomplished as much as I'd like in my life and I've never even once in my life felt as happy as you probably should feel for Christmas or your birthday. I feel like there's this mutual agreement all over the world, that this is the time of the year, the time of your life and simply the time, where you should feel best and some magic miracles happen and your life upgrades itself to next level. (I know it's unrealistic and probably an unhealthy way of thinking, but it seems like subconsciously this thought is stuck with me.) This whole thing stresses me out intensely every year, but this year it's especially bad or maybe it's been that bad the years before and I just pushed it out of my mind. The point is, it's gotten to me physically and I've had a cold for basically a month now and the last few days, my back's been extremely stiff and sore, which is something that usually never happens. I'm panicking intensely even thinking about going home to my parents' place for Christmas next week and I don't know to get through these days/weeks, without feeling like I'll go insane any minute.

Recently I’ve started a side job delivering newspapers and found myself singing along to music happy and not stressing. That’s when it hit me, my brain automatically started to think “why are you so happy? Have you forgot that thing that could happen and cause so many problems? or “I’m way too happy here, I shouldn’t be feeling like this, somethings going to happen that takes away all your happiness”.

"Not sure if I should call a doctor over my work stress? Hey all, So, I work in the Social Housing Sector within the UK. It's a really demanding area to work, with a lot of vulnerable clients needing particular arrangements, that aren't always straight forward - and particularly, a large volume of requests and queries that feels never ending, which I guess is the nature of this sector, having a demanding customer base makes it difficult. At the moment, the team I work in is literally disintegrating in front of my very eyes. Our manager left a month ago, this was after two weeks signed off for stress - ultimately making the decision that he couldn't continue to do the job anymore. Following that, our Team Leader then also went down with stress, and is yet to return after being signed off again. To make things worse, two of our colleagues, out of four, are also leaving by the end of this month, bringing us down to two staff left - we on average are getting around about 50-60 emails an hour to our team inbox, and I'm getting around 10-30 in my personal inbox, we also get ""Jabbers"", instant messages, and these are also relentless. It's also worse because I live in a block managed by the Social Housing Provider I work for, and following lock down (and me being a Type 1 Diabetic) I've obviously been working from my flat, which naturally then followed onto having to use my personal mobile to call customers and contractors, meaning this is now ringing constantly. Ultimately, I am starting to feel like I can't relax at home, it's becoming an office to me - and I have no where else I can work, as others have suggested working in a different room, for example. And again, to make it worse, our team is currently under review for lack of productivity, we're trying our best but we're just literally drowning doing tasks that really don't sit with our team, but because I'm 'just an admin' (The head of my departments actual words!) no one will listen, so I'm now experiencing (I think) anxiety over the future of my job, I know that I nearly had a meltdown on Sunday, following a week off, simply over the thought of what was waiting for me in my inbox for Monday morning. I was throwing things, crying, I can't really remember but know that my downstairs neighbour messaged me to ask if I was alright, as she heard the commotion - I covered up by saying I hypo'd, naturally. Alongside the horrible situations I have going on in my job, I am also the sole carer for my Mum, who is depressed and anxious, and makes at least 2 or 3 attempts on her life a month, she was in ICU over Christmas, so I spent my Christmas alone with her on breathing support in a ward at our local hospital.

"I can't seem to cry when I need to For the longest time, I've remembered crying freely when needed. This crying could be in response to sadness, fear, or anger, but now that I am in highschool, I can't seem to cry unless I am talking to someone. The issue here is that I don't want to cry in front of anyone. I wish I could cry alone without the discomfort and guilt of doing it in front of someone. Instead, when I am going through something that i feel like I should cry about, all I can muster is a blank stare into space. As I stare I begin losing awareness of my environment while I become increasingly anxious and existential. Why does my brain substitute brain spotting for crying? If this is healthy, then why does it feel so frustrating and unnatural? This is not to say I am frustrated whilst staring off, because I am actually very comfortable in this state of numbness and hyperactive thought. It is before and after the fact that I become angry and increasingly sad at the fact that I can't have that hormonal relief that comes with crying.",1

I'm also tired of the routine and sometimes I can't even get up from bed. I feel like shit, not for me but for the people that loves, they are pretty tired of this, I wanna be happy, God damn it!",1
"Both my siblings have mental illness & I’m scared I feel awful to tell my parents that I may have depression & I feel suicidal because my oldest brother have severe autism and my second brother has/had ADHD, depression & bipolar. He does therapy, has stayed in a psych ward and takes medication. I feel like it’s would be a huge burden on my mom to have three kids with some sort of mental illness, and I already have some health problems. Does anyone else have a similar family and any advice?",1
"It’s not that I want to kill myself. But if I die I wouldn’t be upset. I don’t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to die. It’d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn’t right to think like this but I can’t stop. Edit this blew up, it’s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same. Edit 2 thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I’m home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there’s this much support in the world.",1

"Can stuff that’s good in your life actually cause stress? Such as my job which I’m quite proud of but can get busy some days and sometimes I feel like all I want is a break, my girlfriend who can nag me at times and sometimes we argue, my dog who I love but is very naughty in her puppy stage, the house which needs a lot of work including having to do diy with my partners dad (I don’t know anything about diy) and chores, money which is a bit tight atm but I am not really on a budget, a wedding coming up that I’m nervous about and it’s costing a fortune. Do these seem like reasonable things to get stressed about?",1
"How to take life less seriously Hi all, I (24 M) am new to this sub but I think I am in the right place for this post. Basically, I have had an absolute shit year. Last June, I lost my father suddenly to an overdose. We didn't know this at the time - we only found out months later and it came as a shock because we had no idea he even had a drug problem to begin with. Anyway, his death caused a massive ripple effect in our family and being his oldest son I have had to step into some big shoes. I found myself caught in between drama involving my dad's mom and my own mom, while also having to be there for my younger brother (19). My parents owned a restaurant and following my dad's death the building landlord forced us out because he wanted the building for himself. So after learning the results of the toxicology report, we had to scramble to close the restaurant down and get out of the building before the landlord tried suing us again. To help my mom with the restaurant closing I had to leave my job (which I hated anyway) and now I am applying to dental school (another very involved and stressful process) while looking for a new job. Long story short, I just feel like there are a lot of people depending on me all the time now and it feels like a lot of pressure. I constantly feel as though I am behind the eight ball and with each passing day I get more and more stressed out. I am just worried that if I can't handle this type of pressure now, how will I juggle a career and a family of my own on top of all this. I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to stay in the moment and take life less seriously and enjoy it. I find myself putting so much pressure on every decision I make and it ends up stressing me out to the point where I am miserable to be around.",1
"I keep thinking about how nice death would be. Floating in the endless void, unaware of existence. I'm lying in bed and I can't sleep. I feel like shit, just like always. Went to bed 4 hours early because I want today to end. I've had experienced romantic love before, though it didn't last. I don't want to be here without it. And I barely want to be here with it. What good is any of this if I can't fill the void in my chest? Love has come close, it's provided a noticeable fullness before, but it didn't plug the hole. I'm not cut out for living, but I haven't the courage for suicide. Maybe someday I'll go to sleep and not wake up. I still love my ex. I've moved on, but I miss her today. I wish I could say she still loved me. Maybe I would be able to sleep tonight.",1
"Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes? I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep. I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it. I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten. Think I'm going back on the Zoloft.",1
"I feel beyond suicidal Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why. Edit Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone. I wish I could thank each one of you individually! Thanks for being there Reddit. <3",1

"i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification. as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day. for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations). another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy. my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything. i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. just a disclaimer i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it. that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you ) EDIT i'll be deleting this account soon but before that, thank you everyone for the kind words, advice and suggestions! it means the world to me and i'm going to try to act on your advice <3 take care of yourselves )",1

I really wonder for who. I despise waking up so much, the moments when I become conscious again, when I hear the alarm or just wake up naturally fill me with so much dread I can barely take it. Of course i always do in the end because things always have to go on and however bad it is, nothing ends. My personal Day of Judgement is tomorrow and I don’t think I will go to sleep tonight just so I don’t have to wake up in the morning of it.",1
My mother is extremely depressed. So to put a long story short my mother’s parents both died when she was 16 and had to raise herself my father is in prison for attempted murder and she used to be a VP For coke and lost her job due to lay offs. Has not had very good success with jobs ever since. She’s mid 50s and has a lot of physical problems and has attachment issues with animals where it’s to the point where she can’t even take care of them properly I moved back in with my girlfriend to help her out with bills and such whilst she was unemployed due to covid. She now has a new job and her car needs a whole new transmission and can’t afford to have it replaced. When she has 1200 to go towards I offered to front 800 to cover the bill but she ended up spending it all in two days anyways. So she’s been driving in my brand new car to get to work until she can fix her car. On her days off all she does is lay on the couch and watch Netflix that I pay for while I care for her animals. It’s extremely emotionally exhausting seeing my mother like this and idk what to do to make it better. She’s paying for my younger sisters car insurance and I just found out she spent 800 dollars to get my sister a new car. I just don’t know what to do. This is more of a rant than advice but at this point I don’t know what to do.,1

It certainly evened me out a bit as I'm not as mopey, but when I get home I don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross. I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now! I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine. I actually feel like I can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that I never want to do anything at my house.

"I am not sure what is wrong with me. I feel distressed by my inability to connect with other people, and am not sure what to do or where to turn. I do not experience emotional empathy and do not find myself emotionally attached to any person that I know. I do not experience love at all. I have behaved in cold, selfish and manipulative ways in the past, and have done cruel things to others to gratify myself. I am bothered greatly by this for I wish more than anything to connect with someone that I feel understands me and cares about me. I have lived a totally secluded lifestyle for the past eight years. I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at the age of nine (currently 21) and think that I might have something like Schizoid Personality Disorder or perhaps even Primary Psychopathy. I think I might feel permanently dissociated. I feel trapped by the walls that I did not ask for. Walls that were there since my birth, that I have no way of surmounting.",1

I texted my boyfriend of 3 years this, as he is aware of my issues, and all he had to say to me was “sounds good”.

"I don’t need any more stress this year This year has been hell for me. First we were in a bad place to live so needed to find a place to live. Thankfully we found one. But Covid Hit. So we had to move with NO help with two young kids. I packed all of our lives in a matter of days (there is 4 of us!). Cleaned the old place and unpacked at our new place. Due to roommate working to much. March hit and they shut schools down. I was to care for 2 children by myself while my mental health took a toll. My roommate started working from home, but keeping two kids entertained so their dad can work is hard. Not being able to see my family or friends for months and hardly leaving my house. Was tough. July hit, I hurt my ankle. And the doctor is postponing surgery he says I need so much. I can hardly walk. The only person I had was my roommate who was also my best friend. But he wasn’t really there for me. But I eventually started growing feelings after awhile. Then past week he told me he is talking to another girl. Leaving me hurt. I even told him how I felt. But nothing in return. But he’s worth waiting for so I want to wait, so that adds more stress. On top of all that, my dad who is in remission from cancer isn’t doing well. My health hasn’t been the best either. I have epilepsy and suffer from migraines. More episodes, etc. Now I have a heart condition that is scary. And the past 15 minutes I’ve gotten two calls. One from my neurologist saying that since I’ve been having more episodes, may lose my already restricted license. The other from my cardiologist saying the heart condition is worse.

"I’m gonna blow a gasket I’m a male, 16 years old and a junior in high school. I go to a private college prep school with very, very, very challenging work. It’s only been a week of school and I’m already shaking from stress and I’m on the verge of having a breakdown every day. I yelled at my girlfriend for the first time since we started dating almost 5 months ago in a fit of frustration and I immediately burst into tears. I’m having to sacrifice 2-3 hours a night to homework after 7 hours of school and I can’t stand it. I’m dropping AP U.S history (which I thought I was looking forward to) because of how much work it is. But even without APUSH I’m still swamped with work in all my classes. My grades are already dropping, and I barely have time to do the things that actually bring my any sort of happiness. And I feel so weak because of it. Everyone else is just carrying on like it’s no big deal. They know it’s a lot, and they push forward. They take the challenge head on and make it through. They actually contribute to classes unlike me who just sits there silently freaking out and taking notes to save my life. And I’m not even in as many hard classes, nor do I do as many extracurricular activities as some of, if not most of my peers. Some people even poked fun at me when I said I was thinking about dropping AP U.S History. I feel like such a Goddamn quitter and an idiot. But this is just too much for me. I came home every day last week super frustrated and stressed. It’s only been one week. I don’t know if so can deal with 9 months of this without having a huge mental breakdown. I’m so close to blowing a gasket. I hope I’m in the right place to let all this anxiety and frustration out.",1

"Can you be stressed without even knowing it Hey everyone I am just curious can you be stressed or anxious without even knowing it. For example for the last 3 weeks I had this tingling feeling around my chin and bottom lip. So I did the number 1 no no and googled it, well according to google I might have advance cancer and dying in less then a year. That caused me to stress out and think what if I am not around for my kids to see my kids grow up. So I called the doctor and I have an appointment with him on Tuesday but he sent me to get a blood test in advance which all came up perfect except for cholesterol levels. So after the blood test results I think my anxiety lowered but every often I still feel the chin tingling. So back to the question can you be stress or anxious on something without realizing. Thanks for the advice Just an update my doctor doesn’t think my chin is anything even though I still feel the tingling feeling even now. He said give it another month and then we will go for an mri. Is it possible that stress of me worrying has been causing this symptom and if so it cannot be healthy having stress symptoms for like a month Thanks for the advice",1

"Anxiety Causing Head Pressure & Faint Feeling Has anyone dealt with daily head pressure from stress/anxiety that has lasted many months 24/7 and it does not respond to over the counter medication? Since October of last year I have been dealing with head pressure, brain fog, lightheadedness, faint feeling, pressure behind eyes etc that has limited me to basically doing nothing every day due to feeling out of it. I have went to neurologist, ent, eye doctor, hospital twice, gotten lab work such as CT, MRI, MRA, and MRV of the brain and every scan is clear and every doctor can't find anything. These symptoms all came on during an insanely stressful time at the end of last year due to Covid and more. Since they have on, they are 24/7 all the time and nothing has touched them or calmed them even slightly. Nothing makes the symptoms better or worse. Is it possible that my head is just in a viscous cycle where it is constantly tense or in fight/flight and it's just stick in this terrible loop causing these symptoms all the time. I feel as if the anxiety comes from feeling these symptoms but maybe it is causing them and it's a viscous cycle that's just on autopilot subconsciously.

i’m growing depressed First things first i want to say that I am a Christian. I believe in God and I don’t plan on committing suicide but i’m just so confused with my life. They are time that i can be happy one second and then someone can say something i don’t like and i become depressed. I am transferring and I am a rising junior in high school. I play basketball and basketball means so much to me. I think I am fairly good at it and I play competitively trying to earn a scholarship for college. At the school I go to theres is a very unlikely chance I get playing time because I wasn’t recruited. And the junior year is the most important year for a student athlete. Right now I have 0 offers and I believe that can change if I go to public school. I would get playing time and could possibly be the star on the team but my parents don’t care about how I feel and basically I am wasting the most important year of my life because of my parents. So sometimes i get depressed thinking about it and it brings me down. I just want to say it on here because I know if i told my parents it wouldn’t change their mind. pensive_face ,1

I'm a bit tough and blunt so I worried that they might be upset about my way of giving feedback, but the senior animator expressed that he liked that I'm straight to the point and didn't see it as a bad thing.

I'm coming here for some advice on how to get through this because I know I'm not the only one.",1
"Failure is so painful I've been studying for a couple of years, got my BS diploma and am in the final bits of my master diploma as well. However, I won't be making it. I needed to just pass my internship but due to not being able to finish a report on time (after getting 3 extensions mind you) I got the message that I will be failing. After dealing with corona, studying through looking at my screen 24/7 feeling locked up in my room having to deal with my master thesis was already the worst feeling ever. But I also had to give up my parttime job to do the final internship in order to get my diploma and use up all my savings and I end up with a failure. I can't commit myself to another year of studies either because I dont have the money and I have about 80k in student debt. What the fuck do I do at this point? I've felt depressed for an entire year now and told myself ""just a little bit more"" until I would have made it but that just slipped away. I can't find a job with my bachelor diploma because the field I study requires at the very least an Msc so that diploma is complete and utter useless as well. I have just enough money to last another month and I still have another month of internship left (I got a month and a half extra time as extension to my internship due to me struggling with very basic things like reports..). I received an ultimatum and wasn't able to deliver. What do I do? Just no show? Find a job? End it all? What the fuck is the point of anything anymore.",1
"This girl is really stressing me out and upsetting me So a while ago, i meet this girl from FB Dating app, we started talking and when on a couple date. One day i decided to ask her to be my GF and she gladly said yes! So one day i went over to her house to spend time with her and she ask me to have sex with her and i agree to do it, and all i can say, she wasn't good at all. She kept putting her wrist on my neck and was chocking me and i told her to stop. Afterwards, she got upset with me and told me to leave and said she didn't wanna speak to me anymore. Later that same night, i got a message on Facebook and she told me she was really sorry on how things went and i accepted her apology and started talking and hanging with her again. So today we was suppose to hang out at her office and go to the park afterwards to have lunch. So early this morning, i went to the store and brought snacks and things and when i got back home, i told her i was going to get there around 10 50, she wanted me there by 11. She told me to meet at her house and we'll walk to her office yesterday. So after i told her i was coming at 10 50 she started yelling at me over the phone for some reason and told me just come at 11 10 and i had no idea why she was so mad at me.. I just told her to message me when she was there. She message me and told me she wanted me there until 2, then she message me and told me that she wasn't there yet, than she told me she was waiting for people to leave. 30 minutes later, she told me forget it just don't come and stop answering the phone and replying to my messages What should i do with her? She's really upsetting me",1
"I got my first full time job offer, and it's so much better than I could have ever hoped for I'm doing an internship before graduating with my engineering degree in December, and I got the full time offer letter today. Not only is it a position that I'm super excited about with lots of room for growth, but I took one look at the salary and thought ""I never have to worry about money again"". There's been several semesters in college where I've gotten to less than $1 in my bank account so it feels amazing to know that now I can afford to live and save, and have a little extra fun.",0
Even when I’m not stressed with work I feel a bit stressed Does anyone else relate? It’s like even if it’s just a normal day I find myself feeling exhausted by it and I can’t actually be happy ever while I’m at work. I want to not care if it’s a work day or not and feel just as happy regardless whether or not I have work. I don’t know if this is achievable. Obviously I have my days when I feel mega stressed too when the workload is heavy but I want to basically become immune to work and not have it exhaust me and effect my motivation for other things or is that not possible?,1

"The night I had my first kiss ever, and everything leading up to it So, as I've said before in other posts on other subreddits, I have a very close group of friends that I've known since kindergarten and first grade. They're like my own little family and idk where I'd be without them. But, out of all them, the one who I've known the longest aside from my best friend is my now boyfriend. He first asked me out to our end of year school dance for our graduating class, about a month before it happened. I thought at first he just wanted me as his date, which I was totally down with, but then he kinda sorta implied he wanted to actually take me on a date sometime. I was a mixture of confused and full of butterflies. I didn't even really have feelings for him at the time. Sure he's one of the people I trust most in my life and who has always been there for me when I needed him. And sure I'd always found him cute and kind of goofy. But I never found myself liking him like that. But, seeing how nervous he was just trying to ask me out made me realize how much he must have cared about me and made me feel special. So my dad and even my stepmom-to-be (they're engaged) took me dress shopping and the night of, she did my hair for me. I can't really describe how I felt looking at myself in the mirror, but it was like I didn't recognize the person in it. I never put this much effort into my appearance before and couldn't believe it was me. I didn't cry or anything, but I did think about my mom and realized how much I looked like her, especially with how I had my hair done. Even my dad said that, I guess just by pure coincidence, the way my hair was done was how my mom looked on their first date. So we got to the dance and of course all my friends were there as well, all of them complimenting each other on their appearances. But as soon as I walked in, they all turned their heads and made me feel even more angelic. The night went on and we all just loved being in each other’s company and couldn’t believe we were all about to start high school soon. But then of course the slow dance came up and…well needless to say neither of us knew what we were doing and had to look at everyone else lol. On top of being this close to him, even just him having his hands on me, and the way we were both smiling at each other, it was here when he really told me how he felt about me. No “I love you” or anything like that, but just him telling me the things he was feeling, how beautiful I looked, how long he’d had feelings for me, all that stuff. I myself was at a loss for words hearing someone talk or even care enough about me to say these things. I almost thought this was all a dream and wasn’t really happening, so overcome with so many emotions. But then, out of nowhere, something inside me just said to go for it and I kissed him. He looked at me like I had two heads and we both laughed. And we kissed again after the song ended. Even just writing this has gotten me excited lol. This was back in May and we’re officially dating now. We have also since said we love each other and, honestly, I’m probably the happiest I’ve ever been. My daddy of course says he doesn’t like him but I know he’s not 100% serious. He’s usually let him come over to the house or let me go to his. I also love how we have completely different personalities and interests yet can’t stand being apart for long. He’s always been quiet and introverted but I’m usually outgoing and love talking to people. If I had to point out one thing I love about him most, it’d probably be his laugh. Because he’s usually so quiet, when he laughs or even chuckles it takes me by surprise every time. But that’s all I felt like sharing for now. Thanks for reading!",0
"new environment stress I moved to another place in 2020, i didn’t care much for the change of environment and it’s not like I cared much for my old school BUT the thing is, while i was in quarantine (early 2021) i had developed an unstable emotionality state. I became more sensitive and yk that stuff When i finally enrolled in my new school, it didnt help shit. all they did was give me assignments on top of assignments while i was still trying to fix my emotional stability, it didnt help anything. i hate it here, everything is so different from where i was born and lived there for all of my life. I haven’t made any friends, and all my teachers just rule me out as the new student who is lazy and dumb even though i’m trying my best to keep up after LOSING ONE YEAR OF EDUCATION TO QUARANTINE. My mother never asked about how I FELT before ever deciding to move all of us all the way here.",1
"In 8 days I have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and I’ve diagnosed with cancer. I feel so overwhelmingly sad. My whole life has crumbled so quickly. I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do. EDIT Oh my goodness. I went to sleep last night, finally. Woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. You guys are unbelievable. I can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. I love every single one of you. Thank you so much.",1
"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response? First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway. What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question? That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit? Fuckin' hell, man. Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person. I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal. I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time. Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life. Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that."" I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit. Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this? Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move? Afterthought can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression' Haha, fuckin' A.",1

I am just a huge disappointment Hello. Just wanted to make a post because today was a pretty sad day for me. I woke up this morning and went to the bathroom as its usually the first thing I do every morning and when I walked out I overhead my dad talking to my sister about not ending up like me. Obviously this hurt and usually I don't cry much but this morning I cried like a bitch. Hearing my dad say that to my sister really fucking hurts. Ugh. He says that he loves me but sometimes I don't know how true that is. I just wish that I didn't exist. I've been depressed for years and nothing has changed. I have lost nearly all my friends because I'm a complete loser who is addicted to smoking pot because its the only thing that can temporarily cover up the sadness. I'm starting college soon and my parents don't have any faith in me and honestly I don't have any faith in myself. I could barely pass high school because I have 0 motivation. How in the world would I be able to pass through college. I don't know how much longer I can take this shit... I've seen a therapist but she just told me and my parents that my internet use was the problem. Like really??? She was completely useless and I haven't seen one since. I live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and I have everything I could want. A gaming PC. A high end smartphone. A puppy. And life still is just as mundane as usual. The only thing I have to look forward too anymore is smoking a bowl at night. Fuck. I'm starting to get suicidal thoughts and this is becoming really scary. I don't really know why I'm making this post I just wanted to get it all out I guess. I'm just tired of being a lonely loser who has 0 skills I guess.,1
"can gut problems induce stress? I have severe stress problems that need to be addressed in the sense that whenever I get a little stressed about something or I am excited snout something, I get severe anxiousness - I can't sleep at night, get a racing heart or severe stomach ache and nausea. I started mediation to get my emotions in a control range. Lately, however, a new thing is bothering me.

"I quit my gas station job on the spot Hi everyone I was working on a gas station during the summer and I just wanted to tell someone my frustrations. My employer knew I had plans to return to school this 6th of june. I provided my school schedule so she was able to see I am being truthful. I did this a month in advance and I help her to get a replacement for the other 20 hours I wasn't going to work. The week I return to school she didn't change my schedule and i confronted her and she said that she can't change the schedule. I was understanding and I suck it up and fuck my sleep because I knew she was having a hard time. I just tell her that next week I better get my schedule right and she said that I am good employee and wanted to make me assistant manager because everyone in this place have the IQ of someone who is brain damage. Therefore, she went on telling me that she didn't want me to quit. Guess what she fuck my schedule I was pretty clear no more than 20 hours ( two 10 hours shift thats how we did it) And to top it all I worked 11 00 PM- 7 00AM (Graveyard shift) and she wanted me to come back at 3 00 PM. It would have been miserable but nothing crazy but also I had class at 9 30- 12 30. I wasn't able to take it anymore she got to the store I ask her if she knew I had to go to school and I would not be able to sleep and go to work. She only said ""oh I am sorry this girl cannot cover you because she can't (background she is referring to a girl that doesn't go to school, no kids, doesn't work full time because she has to be supervised because she is kinda dump and always come short on the register) I clock off and leave a text message that I won't come back.",1

"I need to find a way to calm down I´m unsure about what is going to happen to me. I have two jobs, one part-time, and one full time. The problem is, I might have been kicked out of my part-time job (it´s a job from home), because an email that was supposed to arrive three days earlier arrived only this morning. For my full time job, I might have to leave it after this summer ends. I´m starting my university, and my contract might not be switched to a part-time one, because the company is slowly losing it´s money, and my boss might not be willing to keep me in there. And now I´m unsure about my future. My mom is moving out at the end of the year, so I have to find a way to work while I´m going to study at an university, and a way to pay my bills, and a new place to live at. On top of that, I haven´t been with my girlfriend in three months due to my tight work schedule. And I also need money to save up money for a ton of stuff for the university. If I´m getting kicked out of my full time work at the end of the next month, then I have only about 900€ to survive with until the end of year. My family is unwilling to help me, because nobody has a place for me to stay at, or the will to help me financially. My heart is racing, I feel heavy. I don´t know what the fuck should I do to easy this stress. I´ve tried watching Shia LaBeouf screaming in front of a greenscreen, I´ve tried watching Bob Ross, I´ve tried ASMR, I´ve tried smoking, but nothing helps. I don´t want to go back to alcohol, because let´s be honest, I can´t afford it. What should I do? How do I calm down? EDIT 1 So, I wasn´t kicked out of the job, my account just got somehow blocked on the page during the process of my supervisors reviewing my work. This morning, my boss responded to my email, and told me that I have two options; I could quit the job or I could stay, but I´d have to be re-trained (I review newspapers as my part time job) and I´d have to work even more, because reviewing 300 pages of newspapers wasn´t enough (he told me that I need to review at least 2000 pages a month). He was very understanding and wasn´t menacing or awful about it. He said that he understands that I might have a time restrain or that I might not feel like doing the job. I agreed to his offer to pay me this month´s work, and I´m now waiting for his response. So yes, I´ve had to quit the part time job. A big stone fell of my heart, as I now have my time for my hobbies back (making music, recording videos, gaming, reading). Also, for my full time job, it was confirmed that I wouldn´t be kicked out. And, because I am at the end of my two months testing period, I´m allowed to take vacation, so now I will have time to go get signed up for my university, and to finally, after two months, go to a lot of doctors (I have a lot of skin problems, my eyesight and colorblindness are getting worse, and maybe even seeking out psychiatric help for my stress, anxiety and depression issues). Turns out, all I needed to do was just to vent to my girlfriend. She was very understanding about my situation, and is very supportive. Thank you all for your advices in the comment section.",1

"Constant noise pollution contributing to chronic stress (can anyone relate??) In the last few years of my life, in 3 different cities, I have somehow managed to live into neighborhoods where they tend to knock down houses to build multi-family / ugly looking Beatle juice houses that seem to take ages to complete (I guess it probably takes a lot of effort to hang up all those light fixtures on the cheap particle board?) On top of that, the places I work are also constantly going under development as the on-site locations from my jobs tend to be in heavily-trafficked areas...It's gotten to a point where I can't ignore it anymore. There's a project that went up to our surprise after a year of living here and no one in our complex has been able to park in front of our unit in over a year.

So we all just stay away from each other, more or less. I've been in this period of ""mourning"" lately for my family that I really lost well over a decade ago. But now those feelings of loss and abandonment extend further out to my friends. It's like I'll be invited or asked to join in on something... And then unintentionally left out when plans change. It's throwing me into a deeper depression that is no one's fault other than my own. If I didn't have kids... I would definitely end this misery of a ""life""",1
"After three years of a crappy job I landed my dreamjob and quit today!!! I'm just so happy so I wanted to share lol For other it's not that special but I could cry of happiness!!! My last job was a boring office job (although I'm thankful that I had a job at all in those hard times), but my boss was the worst and I wanted to quit so bad. After months of applying for different jobs I got a surprising phone call of a company I applied months ago and never heard back. They said that they tried to call me a few weeks after I applied to tell me that the position is already taken but they couldn't reach me (and I never got a phone call lmao). They found my résumé in their records because the position was free once again. I went there, we talked for some time and both agreed it would be perfect for each other. Soooo...

I just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist (and often times don’t even achieve that as I dwell in self neglect...) and pour every minute o can into video games until I’m exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down, because if I don’t then I’ll lay in bed for hours making myself (even more) miserable.

Does anyone else feel like their life is boring as hell and not worth living for? I don't even really have friends and every day is always filled with constant stress due to schoolwork. And I've been called ugly lots of times so my self-esteem is basically in the negatives and I've never gotten a compliment before. And it really sucks seeing all these people your own age having fun with friends/girlfriends being happy. I've always felt like this since forever and there's not even a light at the end of the tunnel. I got college to stress about and I'll be having to get a job soon and get a driver's test. Most of the time I just wish something cool could just happen to me but the reality is that nothing is ever gonna happen since that's the truth. Honestly wish I had an accessible way to off myself without getting run over by a truck or something painful like that.,1
"The grass wasn’t greener.. it was just AstroTurf. Been at my job for 10 months and I finally snapped today.. had a bit of a breakdown in my living room after driving home. The workloads are ridiculous, legitimately everything is apparently “of the highest priority” and “must be sorted NOW”. The second I get in, my phone rings off the hook, emails flood my inbox and I firefight to keep barely on top of it all. If I ask for help I just get excuses or that it’s not in the budget for extra staff. I’m overwhelmed and i hate it. Not to mention if anything does goes wrong, or is missed, everyone takes the opportunity to throw someone else under the bus - it’s horrible to watch. And experience in some instances. I barely get time to have a break or eat, because if I take a second away from my desk I’ll pay for it when I come back. I’ve been in the company but different departments for about 2 years previous so if I leave I’ll miss out on all the benefits I’ve accumulated. I wish I’d never left my old team, I was spoilt with how simple life was and now I’ve had reality punch me in the face. Fuck me right?

"Finals Week Bit of a rant - just wanted to know if anyone else felt the same (excuse the word vomit, i've been up since 6 30 AM for an exam). It's finals week and anxiety/stress is at an all time consistent high. On top of that, our family puppy has been great but I think my school anxiety has trickled in to me worrying over him more than I should, and I constantly get overwhelmed with all the things I have to get done. I can't even enjoy food because I am always thinking too much and get caught up in the stress of school. I literally was eating and saw my puppy sleeping, and I immediately said ""wow he's depressed isn't he"" when he's just SLEEPING. I went out to get food, totally fine, no problem. As soon as I got home it hit me again with all the stuff I have to do. The pandemic has 1000% affected my mental health especially recently, where I don't get any enjoyment of stuff at home because I am always in front of a damn computer screen. I used to see home as a place to leave behind stress from school, and now I see home as the place where I do everything and there's no distinction between relaxing and school. But - the one thing I can hold onto is that it is going to PASS. All of this is going to pass at some point, the brain is just rewiring itself because of the situation happening globally. It's going to be okay, the only way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time. If this spoke to anyone out there, feel free to let me know how you're feeling. How are you coping? \*\*And if there's any puppy pros in the crowd, please let me know what you did to help release some of that feeling of wanting constantly to helicopter over them during times of stress. When I feel relieved, I don't feel any need to check on him constantly or obsess over little things around the house, just when I am overwhelmed; and then, I don't get anything productive done anyways. I always remind myself I am not alone - and neither are you. Even talking to strangers about it can be soothing in a way, just a little reminder that there's someone else out there in your boat during such a difficult time. My counselor said to normalize what is normal during an abnormal time period. And also, don't forget to tell your pets you love them.",1
Done with waiting for change. Done with hoping things will get better. I’m going to push myself even harder now ... even if it kills me! I’m fed up of waiting on other people. It’s clear nobody really gives a shit about me. So sod it. I’m going to go and do my own thing. No help from anyone. I’ve gone this long being a loner I’ll just accept it’s my life. I’m going to adopt a do or die attitude and this will end either with me ending myself or something beautiful. I’m going to apply for every job under the sun.

It can be the most minor thing and it’s either that or the niggling urge to do harm to myself. Like.. I am fine. I have actually been fine for ages... I’m no longer depressed in my eyes, but it is still that automatic response. Then it makes me question if I am fine after all? Probably not.

"I want to cry. I feel like the dumbest person in the world. I’m 25 and currently taking a college precalculus course at community college so that I can have a better future. I grew up poor and getting a good education is a way for me to break free from poverty. I’ve been acing all my classes up until this class which I currently have an 89% in but I have a feeling it might drop significantly due to the fact that I don’t understand the 2 chapters that we were taught. I have a 2 chapter exam and a finals back to back in 12 days since this class is a summer math course and is only 4 weeks. We are currently learning matrices and I just don’t get it no matter how hard I try. We were supposed to be taught how to do this since middle school and high school algebra but of course I went to a pretty bad school and was never taught how to do basic row echelon forms. I feel so left behind compared to the rest of my class. Everyday I study for more than 5 hours and I just cannot pick things up. I go to tutoring sessions, ask professors and students for help and I just can’t understand this chapter. I’ve tried YouTube videos and even performing problems on my own, but it just causes this overwhelming feeling in my brain which I cannot really describe. I wake up at 5am to prepare for this class on top of going to work. My parents are very stressed and tired and I just want to excel in school, make them proud, and take care of them in the future.

"My dad is gone... forever This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.) I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. Me and the baby mama talked and decided we are probably gonna get back together we just need time but right now we are friends and I have been seeing her everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. red_heart red_heart red_heart red_heart ",1

I’ll get fired if I keep it up but when I’m low my mind tells me I want to be fired.,1
"I think the worst part of being depressed for so long is that not only do you start to believe it’s “who you are”, the people around you do as well. I am 21 and have had mental health issues since 14. I can say at 14 it started while 16 it hit scary/severe status. So with that age I’m around my family and friends because I can’t really get away from them. Over time it has become normal to them that I never want to do anything. And it’s true. I know it’s abnormal but I can’t stop it. This “fog” has taken over my personality. I thought I’d be happy when people stopped asking me to do things, because I felt bad saying no.. but now I don’t get invited or included because people just “know”.",1
"Stressful day Spoiler alert this post is mostly venting, but any advice or kind words are appreciated. After 4 days of waking up unwillingly early in the morning and being unable to sleep again, this morning I woke up with a chest on my stomach and tingling in my lungs when breathing deeply, as well as general malaise (body pain, not-clear mind, but no fever or bad cough or else). Last weekend I went out for lunch with a couple friends who recently recovered from Covid, and I have also seen my (paternal) grandparents and another couple friends since, besides sharing every meal with my parents. My other grandpa (91 y.o.) - still not vaccinated against Covid19 - is coming back from the hospital tomorrow after undergoing surgery for a tumour and my parents will go there to help set him up, as he'll require care. I am not only unable to go help them, but also hit with anxiety of potentially having contracted Covid and having passed it to them, as well as to my other grandparents and/or friends (who, thanks goodness, are all vaccinated). Plus, I am writing my PhD thesis, which I need to deliver in a month, and I've got no time to waste being sick. I could postpone, but I'd rather not. Plus I haven't seen my (long-distane) boyfriend in a month, he's supposed to pass by for a few days in a couple weeks and I really need to see him, so much that my feverish mind, spinning thoughts at 200 km/h, was thinking how much I'd want to fuck him holding him against the wall and suck his dick (at least some good thoughts). Plus, my bf and I collaborate on a research projects, and another of our co-authors suggested inviting another senior professor to work on the project with us, which would help our chances to publish it in a good journal, but might reduce our contribution to it. I know he and I have somewhat different views on how to manage this issue, but I should decide about it soon and I don't feel clear-minded enough to do so. Plus, I have been somewhat down in the past months (better now) and tend to be needy at times, so I am also concerned that letting him know I really miss him and need him might make me less attractive in his eyes, and he acknowledged he's not very skilled at offering support to me in this instances. I have booked a Covid test for tomorrow at noon and hope it will go well, but anyway better know one way or the other. I just hope (and know) that everything will turn out fine one way or another, but I really do feel alone and stressed... not even unable to cope with things, because I know I can do it, but I'd just wish it were easier to get some much-needed support, especially from my bf who is the most important person I'd want to rely on. Wishing for a brighter tomorrow, and glad to hear any advice you might have on how to better cope with things. As mentioned, I have been feeling vulnerable and easily taken down in the past months due to a combination of factors (Covid, job-related rejections, ...), I am picking myself up but sometimes it still feels hard to cope with all the shit (which, objectively, is not even that bad, given the much bigger problems that many people are facing these days).",1
Anyone feel like years of their life are like a blur due to depression? I can’t remember the things I did since 2013. Where did time go?,1
Am I the only one with unipolar depression? I've had multiple depressive episodes through out my life and its getting to a point where it's hard to count on one hand. I'm only 23 and I feel like I'm the only one in the world with this many depressive episodes. How many times or how often have you been depressed?,1
I just wanna fucking die already. I didn’t ask to be here. I used to distract myself by watching tv shows to escape from reality but my attention span has gotten so fucking bad I can’t even do that anymore. Why can’t I just die in my sleep and put an end to this miserable existence. I doubt anybody is gonna read this but it’s 3 am and I just needed to rant.,1
"Low threshold for stress Hello, people. So I've noticed this interesting thing only recently- I don't know how it is for other people but I seem to be disturbed or stressed very easily by various things. What do I mean by that? Let's say I'm laying in my bed relaxing and my relative opens a door of another room, I immediately fall into this ""shock mode for a second"", my all attention is on that sound and I become sooo aware of that, there's no more relaxation. Another thing- I could be relaxing and random noise from... Idk, anywhere happen and then I'm all awake, disturbed, tense. So I basically want to ask you- these forms of stress, are they normal? Or is it a sign of something going on? Because I never paid attention to that but as I got more aware of myself because of different practices and teachings, I've started noticing that when I meditate, let's say, a random noise outside can disrupt that more relaxed state and bring me to full awareness/stress mode even when I'm in a safe environment (my home). So is it totally fine? Or should I do something about it and if yes, what?",1

"Parentified parent with severe depression Im a 31 male and at this point Id be glad if someone or something would take my life. It all wen't rapidly downhill after I got my first child, who is a wonderful little boy, now so similarly vital and full of life and energy like I was when I was little. Everybody used to go jesus christ the energy on that boy! I mean everybody. Now I feel dead for a long time and next to the current situation I feel even worse. I was physically parentified by my father - fulfilling his beliefs and standards and taking care of his needs when he was terminally ill with leukemia. For 15 years he held me responsible for him and as a buffer between my brothers and my mother (I'm the eldest). I was emotionally parentified by my mother who couldnt deal with the pain and anxiety of raising children so young and losing herself and doing that with a man with so many problems himself - my father was violent, distant, controlling, bullying etc. Constantly needing my emotional support since I was 6. I realized that this is fucked up when I was 27 and started to notice and address my problems after such an upbringing, while being supportive of both of my brothers who ended up in suicidal depression for a while and in addition dealt with my mom who almost died and was in a coma for a while. I had a few longterm relationships until now where I never wanted to move in with another person cause I've never had enough personal space myself. The relationship I'm in now started 3years ago, we moved in together and that led to suicidal depression at the end of the first year. So I managed to crawl out somehow, but to realize my adolescent years were all in a depressive haze and I never managed to truly find myself and be myself and fully enjoy life as a young person or as a child. Now, after the baby, I feel so alone, so tired and so failed. Finally there's a family I would like to take care of because I want to this time - its my own son and I love him so much, but I've been stuck taking care of my other-family and now I'm just so wasted - mentally and physically. If I'm home, I'm anxious and dont have any personal space and nothing to do just for myself. When I'm at work I fucking hate everybody there cause I didnt have the time to get the hell out of there, which is financially almost impossible now. I loose connection with my mainly single friends who I despise now in a way and I fucking hate everybody else on the streets, traffic and anyone who wants to interact with me. With the kid I see my previous family a lot aswell which is so tiring. I have a small rented room for myself for which I dont have any time to go to or if I'm there I just cry and watch the clock to get back in time to deal with baby chores. So I feel stuck in the same demonic mental state like with my previous family, adding the love and responsibility for my child, which makes it impossible to say ""grow up, I'm out of here!"" My woman is in a similar burnout state, so not much support from there - its the oppisite - I feel I should be the one to support her and I can see how devastating it is for her when i break down which causes in turn so much blame for myself. All of which drains me of the little energy I have left - so now i'm in full suicidal mode again and not able to do any of these things mentioned and no time to do anything I known I need to do for myself to be sane which makes me think why bother at all anymore? On top of that I'm ill aswell atm so a total wreck... I just needed to get it out. I dont know if its the best sub for this, but anybody else been there?",1
"Overly stressed. Opinions & advice welcome. I am a single mother of one, and I work as a 911 calltaker on midnight shift. I am stressed to the point it is causing migraines, I black out, I cannot function. I am tired all the time. Some days I manage to get a ridiculous amount of sleep, other days I get two hours of rest if I am lucky. I need a release.

"I wanna date but I'm just not interesting anymore Depression has turned me into an empty person. I'm 22 and I don't think I have much to offer anyone but I also want to be loved. I don't know how to get out of this cause I feel like I need affection in order to function as a human, but nobody wants to love somebody who isn't functioning. Not even sure why I'm writing this cause I know it's not gonna solve anything EDIT It's cool to see this resonated with so many people, I hope we all find someone ) I am feeling more encouraged to just shoot my shot and see what happens so maybe I'll try and be more brave.",1
"Feel like they lost their spark? It was 3 days ago. It was the second worse day of my life in the past two years. I just screamed as loud as I could! It’s like I totally checked out.

Well maybe I do but being stress is so hard on me because I know damn well I ruined relationships with the people around me. It just started recently and I think the cause of me being stress is how I don't have the usual motivation to do good in my study anymore in result, I got upset with the product which is mainly guilt. I know it's my fault but I want to be on track again. Hope anyone who's reading this can give me some of the tip that helped you to relieve stress. Thank you for your time green_heart ",1
"I cant relax. And I just dont know how at this point I guess for context I'm 16 years old. The post kind of says all of it. I just cant relax. For about a month, I have gone one full year of literal, constant, stress. And by ""constant stress"". I mean from the moment I wake up, to the moment I go to sleep. And there's very little rest from it. Its very exhausting(as you can imagine)and has taken a certain toll on my mental health, and if it hasn't taken one on my physical health it will at some point. It does have a lot to do with my emotional health, which is pretty bad to say the least(loooooot of personal insecurity for a large part of it). I have been going to both a therapist and a counselor, and mostly my therapist has been the one guiding me more through the stress. This includes having less fear with my interests, and trying to sort out what aspects of my life and personality I have control over, and what aspects I do not. And I think trying to know how to work with myself. But I just want to relax. I just want to collapse and finally feel relaxed. It doesn't help that I'm looking for what personally fulfills me and everything that I think is supposed to help me relieve stress makes me even more stress, because of the aforementioned insecurity. Please, if anyone can help me with this, thank you I'll edit this as I find mistakes or have things to add in, if you guys need more info just ask, and also I think in general I'm very sleep deprived so that could have something to do with it. Apologies for any grammar mistakes",1
"I (21f) was depressed About two weeks ago I felt as depressed as I had felt in my entire life, I had developed an internalised homophobia over myself after my father cut me off from his life when I came out, I began to hate myself and I never got better, I even attempted suicide. Soon after that happened my girlfriend started to do everything she can to support me, and over timeout started to feel a little better, although I still have suicidal thoughts, I’m a lot happier now, so if you’re reading this and have depression, just know it can get better.",1
"Fuck u if u discriminate against people with trauma and mental illness You know how many people reject me and judge me for my mental illness/trauma? Guys will fucking play me, act all into me at first, and then flip the script and be like “oh srry this ain’t gonna work out, u don’t rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye” (they don’t say that literally but im trying to summarize lol) LIKE WTF?! You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That’s like saying someone with a disability can’t love someone because they’re not “normal”. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets. Since I’m mental and I’ve been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me, and are surprised when I stand up for myself and don’t allow them to do that. Well, screw you and fuck off middle_finger_medium_skin_tone ",1
"I want to develop a personality and explore new things in life Hey For the past five years I have been consumed in self pity for no apparent reason.

But now I want to change it and live life to the fullest and develop new passions and hobbies but the problem is how to know what I like and what I want to do.

I wish I could stop this pain Yes I'm depressed but also I feel pain. I feel pain from being a virgin at 22. The worst part is im so invalidated and people keep giving me advice but they just don't get it. Depresssion makes me so God damn anti social and boring. I mean idk I've made lots of women laugh and they usually tell me this often but we only just stay friends. I look like an 11 year old so thats probably it. No woman wants to fuck or date an 11 yr old. Regardless I've done self improvement and here I am. Suicidal asf. I guess my future with women is just hookers because I'm done trying with women. My college is online so no parties etc for me. Its over for me. I hate this life. I feel so useless and ugly seeing how most adults get laid normally. Oh well. Anyways anyone who thinks I have lots of time just doesn't get it.,1

"25 years old with absolutely no friends I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her. This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point. But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider. Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday. It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it. Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it? EDIT I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone. ",1

"I hate the department I work in, I'm getting transferred finally. I work for the Canada Revenue Agency, been there 2.5 years. When you start, you're generally thrown into the collections department or some other place nobody wants to be. I was doing ok for a while and even got selected to work a more advanced workload after several months. Then the pandemic happened and I've been thrown all over the Agency, I'm thankful they kept me employed while collections was halted, but it derailed my learning progression. I've been worried a lot recently about my productivity since coming back to collections, I need ground up re-training to function at this point. Then a miracle happened, my Team Leader announced to us that a different department is expanding and will be filled by officers in my current role. I put my name in and I've been accepted. I don't know when I start training, though it will be sooner rather than later they say. The bottom line is, I finally get to leave collections. For the first time in 4 years I'm going to actually enjoy my job I think.",0

"life is a chore Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life.

We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there? In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything.

I was on shift last night and was stuck in the Yoghurt aisle by myself and at out store it is really a three person job but again we are understaffed. I have worked in the Yoghurt Aisles a few times so I wasn't that worried. However the dayshift left the back store room a mess and I really didn't have time to properly tidy it like I usually would if there was more then one person there. I tried my best honest to god I really did but apparently it was not enough. In the end the manager pulled me into the office and reprimanded me saying that I was in charge of it and need to make sure that it is perfect before I leave. I tried to explain the issue and he screamed at me saying that he had no time for excuses and that I needed to do better. Usually I have better control of my outward emotions and wouldn't break down into tears unless I was alone but I was exhausted and stressed and In the end I just couldn't control it and broke down in tears. I'm mortified and don't know how the hell my supposed to show my face there come my next shift. I'm so embarrassed.,1
"What do you do next? So I've sorted made it through the second major depressive episode, slight psychosis like symptoms and hospital stay... I just don't know what's next? I feel ok now, not really even depressed... I've got a plethora of medication a booking with some private psychiatrist and a psychologist that'll be a fairly significant ongoing cost - what are these people really going to be able to do for me? I have a few more weeks off work still and have had about 8 weeks off now. I don't feel super secure with my job there anymore... Second time off for mental health issue in 3 years, I expect I'll be top on the list to remove come next redundancy or performance review etc. I'm reading, learning and doing what I know to help try stimulate BDNF and neurogenesis.. I don't want early onset dementia - if I can help it at all. I've applied at a lot of jobs, haven't heard much back yet but it's still early. I figure finding work and continuing to do the normal things is the right thing to do? It just seems weird that I've gone through this near delusional psychosis event, in a hospital under watch and keep and now I'm spat out at home and I guess left to it. I just don't know what to do. I don't even know if I am really recovered yet? What does recovery even look like now.",1
"Best ways of coping with stress I just started work experience at a garage near me and i had an awful time. I embarrassed myself countless times and idk what I'm doing a lot of the time so I just stand there and look like an idiot. I got home from work and went to sleep instantly because I felt terrible. I woke up and started talking to my mom and I started bawling because of how hard it is and how I know no one or what I'm doing at all and I really can't hold conversations. And now I'm here writing this and I feel as if I going to vomit because I must go back for another 4 days and I don't think I've the will power to. I'm going to try convince my mom to talk the next two or three days off saying I've a fever or something because I genuinely can't handle it. But if that doesn't work, does anyone know any methods to deal with the stress???",1
"Burden on my parents Recently I gave an exam and it wasn't good, when I talked to my friend she attempted almost all the questions it really felt shit after listening to her bragging bout her exam. Now I feel like I am just a burden to my parents, it's so difficult to not compare her and myself, I am never good enough no matter how hard I try, I feel sorry for my parents that they have to bear me, They spend so much on me and I can't even give them good marks. I feel useless, why can't I be good enough, what happened to me, I just wanna leave everyone so they can be again happy. I am nothing but just a useless dumb person",1
"Im a shut in for almost 10 years I lost my ability to communicate. No friends. I have a sister that doesnt talk to me.

One of my Neighbors really hates me, spreading bad news about me, making it more difficult to make friends. I dunno what to do with my life except giving as much love to my granma shes 86 btw, after i dunno aymore.

"I lost interest in almost everything It's been 2 years since I moved from my hometown to another city for studies. At first, I thought that everything would go well, but when I arrived, something wasn't right. I knew that my shyness and introversion would prevent me from living to the fullest and my prediction was right. I made some friends, of which none seems as a genuine friend, but more like people to hang around. I was 18 at the time and I never had a relationship with a girl before and this continues up to this day. I moved to my hometown a year ago because of the pandemic and things got better coz of my family and friends. But my parents keep telling me things like ""you have to find a girlfriend"". I don't want to open up to them and I'm in a phase where I don't get out from my house at all, spending all my time on the internet and being lazy not being to do anything... My self esteem is lower than ever and I get jealous of people so easily that I can't stand it anymore, especially people who are really funny or smart and socially confident. I don't like my friends anymore and I always find reasons to make myself feel inadequate and worthless. I sometimes feel that I am dumb and there's nothing I can do and that I've lost my sense of humour. I keep overthinking and overanalyzing things all the time. I'm almost sure that I have depression, but sometimes I wonder if I have social anxiety too. What should I do? Is spending money to a psychologist a good idea?",1
"I feel it coming again I feel it coming again. I’m so tired. I’m so tired of fighting. Just when I thought I had overcome it. It just creeps up again. I don’t know what to do anymore. Is it always going to be like this? A never ending battle? I feel defeated at this point. I just want to scream. i’m so tired of this. I can feel it coming again and all I can think is I don’t want it, I don’t want it again. god I can’t do this anymore",1
"Looking for someone relatable to chat to Hey! I’m a 28yo guy who finds himself in a bit of a pickle. I used to be a very happy-go-lucky type of guy but I always had some anxiety I struggled with. When I turned 18 alcohol helped a lot in reducing the anxiety but in turn I used to get very drunk to try to not feel anxious. I didn’t really mind at the time, it seemed like a good trade. I figured my anxiety would get reduced by getting older and getting more self-esteem. I got older but my self-esteem and anxiety only got worse. I started prioritizing online friendships over real ones as I felt less crippled by anxiety and could be more true to myself and not keep up the facade that I had built irl. I had a lot of fun online with some great people but eventually we stopped playing together as much and talking less and just split up. During this time I got more and more depressed without even realizing it at first. Eventually I didn’t talk to anyone irl and the few ones I had online I felt I couldn’t talk or play with. I felt nothing was fun anymore. And very slowly I started realizing that I was becoming depressed. A year of depression go brrr and I’m here. I feel I’ve learned a lot about myself this last year. How, why and when. I’ve never had meaning to my life but I’ve never needed it because I kept myself busy doing things I enjoyed. Now in my current state I do still struggle to find enjoyment in things but I know at least one thing I want and that is to make contact with people. Find someone I click with. I feel like I’m getting better but loneliness is a big hurdle and while I get more of my irl sorted I would love to have someone to talk to. I’m big into internet culture and music. Some anime stuff. I love party games (pls invite me to jackbox etc). I hope I’m not breaking any rules with this post. Please reach out if you find any of this relatable and maybe we can chitchat )",1
"Overthinking to the nth degree wanting some advice around this. I feel I am very susceptible to overthinking almost everything. This could be over anything, small and big. I found myself sitting there stressing over money, my current situation in life, where my life is heading, whether I am walking the right path, and whether that will lead me to where I want to be 40/50 years from now. sometimes it really gets too much and I just want it to stop, I just can't stop thinking most times. how do I just accept my life is what it is and just live more in the moment, I just feel like I'm swimming in circles and chasing my own tail. It makes me feel sad. My partner believes I could have ADHD which could be making this worse or at least seem more intense and overwhelming. ",1

Of course even if i could i would not beat the shit out of them because it will hurt my mother more than now. So im thinking to rent a small/simple house for us, but first i need the money. ",1
"My bipolar mother is stopping me from getting vaccinated and I’m losing my fucking mind I’m gonna fucking break something, I swear to god. I should also mention I’m all sorts of mentally ill as well. I don’t know exactly what I have, had so many diagnoses thrown at me, Major Depressive Disorder, Persistent Depressive Disorder, BPD, Bipolar Type 2, PTSD, C-PTSD, and a couple more so I really can’t make heads or tails of my own issues. But suffice it to say, I’m not the most stable, well-put together person either. But I had to move back in with my mum recently cause I was living in the middle of Sydney working as a bartender when the delta wave hit here. I lost my job and couldn’t afford rent or anything, had already sold most of my stuff to try cover it but eventually I had to give in and move. I really didn’t wanna live with her again, she freaked out and kicked me out at the start of the first lockdown and it almost left me homeless. Didn’t even speak to her for a year after that but I buried the hatchet to go to her wedding. Anyway, I ran outta options and now I live with her again. But she’s freaking out all over again. She refuses to get vaccinated because she’s convinced it’ll kill her, but she also think that the second anyone leaves the house they’ll get COVID and bring it back which will also kill her. Guess it doesn’t really matter I have literally no friends and never leave the house anyway, only used to go to work and the gym but works not an issue and gyms are closed anyway. But I’m literally not allowed to leave the house, period. Can’t even go for a walk or sit in the sun or check the fucking mail. I want to get vaccinated because I think it’s the responsible thing to do right now and I’d like to have the option to go to the post office or the chemist or maybe have face to face therapy sessions again at some point (virtual therapy is awful for me, there’s nowhere I can go in my house where I won’t be overheard and I’m never alone so I can’t speak freely which kinda defeats the whole point of therapy) and so I told her I was gonna call up a medical centre nearby to get vaxxed tomorrow. But she’s not gonna let me apparently. She’s convinced I’ll get the virus and bring it home from the medical centre. I’ve tried telling her that’s pretty unlikely and that now is the safest time cause cases are only gonna rise every day I wait and all this shit but it doesn’t matter. She won’t listen to reason. Despite being 22, I never got my full license cause she was always too scared to teach me and I couldn’t afford enough lessons to get my hours that way. So I *could* drive myself, but legally, I’d need her in the car. Also it’s her car. So unless I steal her car and break the law, potentially losing my licence in the process, I literally can’t get it. I feel like a fucking kid again, like I’m not being allowed to make my own choices. It’s infuriating. She’s also talking about moving somewhere super regional cause “it’s too dangerous here” and I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do if she does that. I’m just stuck, my hands are fucking tied. My entire future at this point is bound to the decisions of someone who’s quite literally delusional. I have no one. No one can help me. I have no money. I couldn’t even afford my fucking meds this week, had to come off them cold turkey, so now I’m also dealing with the most fucked up SSRI withdrawals on top of all this shit. I just wanna fucking kill myself, I really don’t know what the fuck to do. I’m just trapped, completely fucking trapped cause I’m too poor and alone to do anything about the walls closing in around me. This is so fucked up…",1
"Struggling with school i started my new year last september. every single day i have been in school i have felt incredibly sad and stressed, even when in my free periods where i have no lessons. i have no idea why when i’m surrounded by good friends and my boyfriend. when i return home, i still feel sad and alone from the day. it is a constant cycle of me feeling alone, tired, stressed, sad alllll the time! i am sick of feeling like this. i have tried talking to my tutor who i see every morning, and the head of my year. however nothing seems to have changed. friday’s are my worst days as i have a lesson which i frequently have anxiety attacks in. i want to stop feeling this way ( is there anyway i could possibly have less stress? thank you in advance ) TL;DR = i struggle with stress and anxiety everyday at school, how can i change this?",1
"Hey, I've been feeling terrible recently Hello, Im on the younger side of reddit of around 14 I guess and I've been so stressful recently. First, There was corona. Somone in my house yelled at me everytime I went outside, and it began there. Next, school was canceled and my mom started signing me up for all these classes I hated. Im still taking this math class where I sit there with a bunch of people younger than me and I dont have a clue of what I just heard after 2 hours of wasted time on stupid math. Next, my piano teacher is sooo stressful! Every week I have something one day of the week. Then, when my piano comes im not so good at is and my piano teacher shouts at me. Shes called me ""lazy"" twice and she says ""DANG GONIT, COME ON!"" and it just BUILDS to my stress level. After comes my grades. My grades are worse than last year and Im just on the verge of crying every day. Before all of this one of my oldest friends started acting up and not being herself for so long. I ended our friendship since she just leaning on me and then getting mad at me for all these little things that were not my fault. Im just..so depressed.",1
"I passed my state insurance licensing exam For over a decade, I have worked underpaying jobs and dreamed of getting into selling medical insurance to make some real money. I turned 40 last month. Time isn't on my side when it comes to saving for retirement at $12.00 to $13.00 an hour. But I have passed my state exam, applied for license, paid the fees, scheduled for fingerprinting, and I start my onboarding on July 12th. Really feeling a time crunch and all this has cost me about $500. All reimbursed through employment. I have never felt more panicked and excited at the same time. Just thought I would share that I have finally been given a chance to work a real job I want to do and potentially get paid far better than I have ever been paid before. Thank you.",0
"How can I improve my stress threshold? I get stressed very easily and very quickly. Loud noises are particular stressors, eg. Someone vacuuming or playing drums. I had a particularly stressful event occur today and my Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was at 198bpm. My resting heart rate is around 55bpm and often drops down to the 40s so this really scared me. Is there a way I can increase my ‘tolerance’ and threshold so that I am not getting stressed so easily? I run everyday and the exercise certainly helps my overall mood but I don’t feel it helps how easily I get stressed. ",1
"If the moods of normal people fall between ""happy"" and ""sad"", the moods of depressed people fall between ""distracted"" and ""miserable"". Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success.",1
"Getting burnt out... I dont know what to do. I'm currently in university and sturggling to keep up.

Though, I've been working out more and eating better. I still get moody, The first thing I usually do when I get home is just take my clothes off, switch off the lights and sleep.

"This is not where I pictured myself. I’m a 27 year old dude who had a much bigger vision of where I would be at this point in my life. I am however, thankfully married to a wonderful woman and have been for 5+ years. I feel as if I have been failing her. In the beginning of our relationship, I promised so many grandiose things. I have provided some but not many of said things. I promised a house, 2 kids, a stable job and or career, a degree of some form and more. I have not yet provided any of the fore mentioned promises. I feel like I may have told her some of that to keep her hopeful in me and by my side. The last two years have been especially tumultuous all due to self inflicted wounds. I’m a recovering alcoholic for the umpteenth time (60 days sober), I have been fired from multiple jobs because of erratic behavioral patters and have pushed away many of our friends over the past 2 years. I am doing my best at the moment. I know others have or had it worse, but I am NOT the man I thought I’d be. Especially to a lovely woman who has had my back through it all.

up since 2 30 I've been up since 2 30 stressed with work. I've been dealing with stress for a while now and it can be traced back to a few mistakes I made a while ago.

"My philosophy on suicide A little while ago I vented about how unhelpful it was to tell suicidal people about how other people would feel if they committed suicide, the main reason being that a person who's in the suicidal mindset will feel worse off because it makes them feel guilty about being suicidal, and instead people should put their focus when talking to a suicidal person on that person's emotions. I didn't express that very clearly in the last post, because I was pretty angry and wanted to get it out. Though, some concerned about if I was gonna kill myself. While I appreciate the concern, and I have had suicidal tendencies for a while now, I'm not gonna kill myself, not for a long time at least. That's because I like to create music and stories and shit, and at the risk of coming off as pompous, I'm an artist at my core. I have so many projects I want to finish and share, and I think every time someone creates a piece of art, metaphorically speaking, they put a little piece of their soul into making it. Soul as in, their energy, their experiences, their emotions, etc. I'm very lucky to sometimes have the energy to create art, and I have projects I want to finish, and if I'm dead, I'll never be able to finish those projects. The longer I live, the more experiences I'll have, including experience with anxiety and depression, the more my soul will grow, the more art I can create. The day I finish all of my projects and I have nothing else to give to the world, nothing I can create, I've created all I've could, that's the day I kill myself, because I've finished what I live to. But if I keep on willingly living, I'll never run out of stories to tell, I'll never run out of art to make. That's why I'm not gonna kill myself. So don't worry about me. But I hope some of y'all can take what I say to heart, maybe there's something you can keep on living for. If you don't know or don't think there is something like that in you, you just haven't realized what it is yet.",1
"The worst part of the depression, is that feeling, deep deep down, that the reason you're depressed is because you want to be. It's just the thought, that maybe you know how to be happy. Maybe all the stuff you read online, the stuff your family tells you, the stuff you hear from your therapist, maybe it all goes somewhere in your head. Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them. It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it. And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know.",1

"Making the situation for myself better in the last year of high school So this senior year wasn’t supposed to be good, it was locked down due to covid and on top of that I always struggled in high school.

But no, I said I’m gonna try my best to make this the best year yet. And damn it I did. I reached out to those i wanted to be friends with and they gave me a chance and befriended me. For once in my life I had someone, if not multiple people to talk to in the halls at once, people stopping outside the classroom to wave to me inside, and more. I got invited to parties, talked to girls, and still am talking one who it’s looking good with. Me and my friends did the school softball tournament and I started a team and everyone wanted to be on it, it was the best. It made me and still makes me so unbelievably happy and warm inside to think about this year, and how well it’s gone, so I wanted to share it and just say that no matter how bad things may be, how terrible and sad life might seem, you always have a choice to try and make things better.

"How do I stop stressing about work when I'm at home? My job can be a bit intense there are a lot of deadlines, and you're often having to make fairly important decisions with limited information. I can't stop thinking about work in my time off. In my head, I go over and over all the work I have to do and obsess over any mistakes I've made. Sometimes it's so bad I can't concentrate on anything else I just end up stressing more and more, and the tight feeling in my chest gets worse, until I've convinced myself I suck at everything and I must be in the wrong career.

Come home today to find out that boyfriend had a great day at work, and got a call from his buddy offering him a better job for more money. Proceeded to get into heated argument with boyfriend because he feels like he’s carrying everyone because he makes the most money in the household. He’s stressed because he doesn’t think we’re going to be able to find a place in time before our lease is up because I don’t make enough money and heave never actually “been an adult” and I don’t take risks. Granted. I’m 26, don’t own anything. Nothing has ever been in my name. I rented an apartment for one year when I was 22. Moved back in with my parents. Boyfriend doesn’t understand how we’re going to be able to get a place when I have no credentials. I’m stressed because he’s stressed and I don’t understand what’s happening. I’m not thrilled with my job right now. I’m mad because I’m struggling I’m worried about having to move I’m stressed about not being able to find a place in time.

"How exactly does stress cause chest pain? I recently experienced a lot of stress at work and have been having acute chest pain for more than a week. Since I'm also drinking alcohol every evening to reduce the stress, I thought the alcohol caused the heart pains. So I went to a doctor, to find out. After a series of tests, nothing abnormal whatsoever was found. Even though I was feeling a strong stabbing feeling in my heart area during the tests. Normal blood pressure, no irregularities in heart beat, etc... So it was concluded that it is stress related. But I still don't get it. The pain I'm feeling is very real. It's stabbing me in the heart and sometimes I'm feeling really faint and about to pass out. The doctor says it can happen with stress. But I don't understand how?? How can my body feel so bad, yet all tests reveal that everything is perfectly normal? What's the process that gives pain without physical reason?",1

Then covid happened and everything seemed even more hopeless. I was depressed and feeling very lost; I was even thinking about giving up music to pursue something easier with better pay. Then I was spontaneously offered my dream job by a mentor I once had. No application or interview, because they believed in me that much. All I had to do was sign the contract. I'm pretty young and inexperienced, but they have so much faith in me. That has to mean I have some value, right? I start this week, and so far I have gotten to work with and form a colleague relationship with this person, who has been my idol for a decade. They inspired me to become a musician and pursue my dreams in the first place. I feel like I couldn't even dream up a better scenario for myself. I am just over the moon. My existence feels meaningful and validated. What do I even do with all of this gratitude?? While I am terrified of ruining it and the job is really nothing huge, it's big to me.

"My parents thought I died in my room and were prepared to bust down my door One day, when my parents went away for the weekend and I drilled two deadbolt locks to my room. Why? I have no privacy in this house. When my brother was angry at me that same vacation, he kicked down my door and threw a pail of kitchen garbage all over my room. The ""lock"" on my door is easy to unlock, apparently my parents are able to open it easily and have been snooping into my room when I'm not there. The day before yesterday, I had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me; knocking over dishes and screaming that I ate so much. I locked myself in my room and didn't eat anything the whole day after that. Today I wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back. I see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way; but the two deadbolts were there. That probably was a surprise to them. I didn't want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door, so I opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door. There were so many things left unsaid, I wanted to yell at them for more reasons. They only care if I'm physically dead, not dead inside.",1

I don’t say anything I just pay and leave, and hope that person (or small group) smiles a little when they go to leave. Today at a cafe (which wasn’t the cheapest place I might add) I noticed a table of 4, with a caregiver and 3 intellectually challenged individuals having a meal. I asked the cashier quietly to pay their bill as I paid my own. As I walked to my car I was really happy and it was purely because of the feeling I had from that moment of doing something anonymously for someone else.

"Today was my 21st birthday I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days) one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. EDIT The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

"I'm forced to move home (into a 1-person rental for the first time) and my employer throwing us through an organisational restructure at the same time. The stress is colossal and I don't think I'll find a way out of all this alive. What can I do to manage all the stress? So, the stress I'm trying to manage is quite the beast. I've put it in dot points to help separate each stressor, but it's still a mess, so sorry in advance! * Work has been putting us through a restructure since July 2020. * My job doesn't exist in the new structure, and I'm genuinely terrified that I lack the skillsets to do any of the jobs, even in a learning capacity. I've applied for a few jobs in the new structure to further my career, but I've failed to get a single interview to date. * I'm terrified about looking outside my current employer, as I'd have to start all over again. My skillset has unfortunately only become relevant to the employer I'm with. I graduated a bachelor in Information Technology in 2016, but it's been so long since then that I've actually forgotten most of the programming stuff I did, and starting again will put me back into the suicide mentality (I think I'm really shit at it, but it's all I have and I don't want to go through the additional stress of reskilling or going back to a shitty retail job that will just make me hang myself in 6 months. Taking an entry-level job at work also isn't an option, as there is no career progression here unless you basically do someone else's job because they're too shit to do it themselves. That's how I got into my current job, and I absolutely don't want to go back to answering the phones again. Backwards is not an option. * The last batch of jobs in the new structure came out yesterday and finish in 2 weeks. Applying for these takes about 5-6 hours each, as they want you to write a billion fucking things as part of the application, and each job's application requirements are different from the last. * I had to move out. * My situation with flatmates was a risk to my health and immediate safety, so I need to jump ship ASAP. Due to COVID-19, no-one is moving (0.1% of homes in my city and surrounding cities available to rent this month, as opposed to \~10% this time last year), meaning every place I inspected had over 30 people apply for them. I never heard back regarding my applications. Fortunately, my cousin's friend bought a place and desperately needs someone to fill it. The rent is higher than what I was looking for by about $100/week, but due to COVID-19, the rental market is fucked right now and has driven the rent prices up everywhere in my state in my country. He offered me the place, but it's unfurnished, so I need to purchase all the furniture and appliances and organise all the amenities. Due to my job instability, I literally don't know if I can afford anything should I find myself unemployed and burning money to keep myself afloat. I didn't want to be in a position where I have to move home and find a new job simultaneously. I simply don't have the mental capacity to handle both of these all on my own, even with the help my psychologist provides and friends doing their best to help me out where they can. I'm genuinely terrified that it's all going to be too much and I'll kill myself very soon or later this year if this stress goes on for too long.

"I need at least one person to see this. I have 0 reason to live, because I can't care about my obligations to others. If you google ""reasons to live"" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried.",1
"Each month that passes I feel sadder and sadder. Please, somebody read me. Hello. Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot. I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore. Thanks for getting until the end.",1
"Anyone here deals with stress being a doctor? I've recently graduated and got my MBBS degree to practice as a GP. As per our rules here, I've to do internship for 12months at all the subspecialties so that we can provide medical care to any patient at any time. So I've to work everywhere including ER or Critical Care or at ICUs and stuff. So there have been patients which were really in bad shape and some of them died. I mean, you get sensitized after a while but it does end up adding to the constant stress at the end of the day. I've become depressed, dealing with anxiety issues, sometimes it's real hard for me to control my temper. I realize I've become less nice as a person and more a cold one. But it does hurt me at the end cuz all of my day's work kinda suffocate me. Also, I'm highly competitive and somewhat of a perfectionist so I'm really stressed about my career too. Does anyone know how to deal with this? I never drink (religious issues), never had drugs, have a few close friends but don't know how to share this with them cuz it's always ""Get over it"". Any suggestion, any at all - is welcome. Edit I'm a woman and I work crazy hours. It varies from 50- 70 hours or more depending on my shift schedule - night and day. So yes, might be a case of burnout too.",1
"My Struggle with depression steroids is in its finals I'm a 23 years old young boy who has been struggling with depression for the past 2 years, I used to take a 10 mg dose in the first six months which was very difficult to endure and now my doctor has decreased the dose to 2.5 mg and this is a win for me, I still sleep 10 to 15 hours a day because of the medicines I take however, I feel so good. I am looking forward to end this and waiting for my doctor to declare my victory.",1

"Don't you just hate it when some depressed people act like you don't get to be depressed because ""life isn't hard enough for you""? I've stopped my friends from killing themselves a total of six times, and I'm 18. That's one of the main reasons I'm depressed.

"Up late stressing about getting let go from a contract earlier today, my boyfriend reassured me it’ll all be okay while fast asleep My boyfriend sometimes sleeptalks sweet nothings and doesn’t recall it whatsoever the next morning. It’s usually that he loves me or that I’m pretty, just silly sleep babble. Earlier today I got let go from my biggest contract (and my last “real job” other than working for myself) so experiencing some financial anxiety though I’m ready to take the leap into being fully self-employed. It’s nerve-racking but exciting. I’m up later than usual stressing about it. My boyfriend is sound asleep and he just rolled over, cuddled me and said— “hey beautiful — don’t worry. I’m going to take care of you and I believe in you.” Just so sweet and so pure to have a partner who is such a grounding influence through life changes two_hearts and who believes in me even when he’s sound asleep!",1

I'm not going to kill myself but everyday I feel like dying Every single day I feel like I want to die. I'm tired of feeling useless and having no real talents. My drive to achieve any goals has faded. A part of me doesn't want to care about being successful The rat race is driving me crazy. I've been fired from almost every job I've had. Even the job I had with someone in my family. They told me I had too many mental problems. Everyday I watch my family go to jobs they hate and spend most of their free time sleeping. I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house. I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company. Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me. When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time. So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome. My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have. Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment. If anyone read this I will be surprised. God please help me ! ,1
Dating is stressful but do it because i want love. I (28f) absolutely hate dating but i want love. I’m constantly stressing myself out whenever i become interested in a new guy. I stress because im constantly asking myself if im not good enough for him... especially when he doesn’t respond for hours. I stress when he says he wants to go out but flakes last minute. I stress when I’m with him and i can’t read if he’s interested. Then i stress when i think he’s just being nice when i ask him something and he gives a good answer. Of course i ALWAYS play it cool. Like laughing it off when he flakes. Or saying no worries when he cancels. Or giving him space when i don’t want to look too clingy. But inside I’m going crazy! I want to turn this worrying off. Does anyone else have this issue? I don’t like feeling this way and i don’t know how to stop feeling so stressed about this!,1
"Can’t manage to stay stress-free for long I’m so tired. I had a wonderful weekend, fairly low stress. Then I made the mistake of looking at my assignments page since tomorrow is Monday and, alas, a new school week begins. One of my profs just...I don’t think he realizes we students actually have lives?? He’s constantly giving us so many new homework assignments without any warning - and his class portal is never fully outlined, so yeah, no warning at all. So, now I’m coming out of the weekend (that was so peaceful) with a fresh load of stress caused by a new ton of homework. Frankly, I’m upset, stressed, and a tad angry because I feel like I’m drowning under the weight of all of this. I can’t catch a break. Every time I get ahead, something happens that shoves me back again. Every time I knock out two assignments, five more take their place (and I’m not exaggerating - I went into the weekend with two assignments and finished those, and now I have five more that came out of nowhere). Any advice to save me from this overwhelming sense of being lost while I scramble to complete these assignments? I’ll finish them all on time because I HAVE to, but without any proper, healthy stress management, I’ll be in tears the whole time.",1
"I feel like I'm going to die from stress at my new job Hi everyone, I recently started a new job at a different company. The job is really an amazing opportunity and I'm really scared not to fuck it up. Yesterday I had a meeting with a manager I would work very closely with, and I was expecting him to tell me his expectations for my work, but it turns out that I came unprepared for the meeting and didn't leave a good impression - he was very unfriendly. I'm so stressed and worried not to get fired - I'm under probation for the next six months, and it's very easy to fire someone during this time and after probation it's almost impossible to get fired. I don't know how will I survive these first months - last few nights I can't sleep, I have nightmares, I'm smoking a pack cigarettes a day. I honestly don't know how to handle this stress!!!! Any advice is more than welcome. Thanks!",1
"Just want to talk... I consider myself pretty hopeless, I haven't found a purpose, I'm extremely lonely. Whenever I try and improve, I still end up self-sabotaging.

I have extreme anxiety on top of the depression, which literally makes me afraid of living. My therapist is not available due to sickness and I'm struggling.",1
Spending money on necessities makes me extremely stressed Hi I’ve never really posted on Reddit and not sure if I’m doing this right but hi. I’m really stressed about spending money on anything. I have a decent amount of money right now but I still feel stressed any time I need to make a purchase. I always end up obsessing over the thing I need to buy and I’ll research the product for at LEAST 3 months before I buy it. And when I buy the thing I always feel guilty afterwards ( Does this happen to anyone else? Any tips on how to not feel guilty?,1
"I called the suicide hotline, the lady seemed irritated and then abruptly put me on hold. I’ve been very depressed and having intrusive thoughts. I had a big panic attack at like 4 30am and no friends were awake to call at that hour, so I went on a limb and I called the suicide hotline. I told her I have been depressed for a long time, my life, finances, family, job, everything is going terribly. I keep having the thought that it’d just be easier to end it all. I’ve been abusing alcohol heavily as well. She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn’t seem to help at all so I stopped going. “Um, you can afford alcohol but you can’t afford therapy?” She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up. Yes. I am a mess, lady. That’s why I called! I left the conversation feeling so much more shitty about myself. Edit thank you everyone!",1
"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected. I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on. People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations. By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty. The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease. The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop. Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance. People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war. Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter. Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after. I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later. I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life. Love used to be my hope, my north star. But in the words of ""Daughters"", LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. And the reason it's disgusting is because it's the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence.",1
"I need to get this off my chest, I don't care who sees it. When I was a toddler- ages 2 to 5- I was raped by my father. When I was 9, my best friend, who was my cousin, committed suicide in front of me. when I was 14, I was abused sexually and emotionally by my boyfriend, then when I was 16, I was abused by my girlfriend. I'm 18 now, and I'm not alright. Sorry if this is too graphic, I've been going to therapy, but it isn't helping, so I came back here. I don't want advice, I just want to get it off my chest.

"muted myself to cry while on the phone with my mom the idea of her daughter having depression is just unfathomable to her (ironic because she works in a rehab center). if i give even the smallest hint to my declining mental health, she immediately starts to tell me stories of all these people she knows that have it worse. i had to mute myself to cry because all it does is make me feel more bad. i understand some live in tougher situations that i do. but that doesn’t motivate me to make a better life for myself. if anything, i feel like more of a failure and there’s literally no point to anything. fingers crossed i die in my sleep tonight <3",1
"I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f) This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do. Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared. I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this. Edit I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up )",1

"Can you be severely depressed and high functioning? I keep taking online quizzes for depression and I keep getting severely depressed, but I think if I'm depressed I'm high functioning. I don't think most people would think I'm struggling. I seem like a happy person, do well in school, get stuff done, but it is so hard to do every day. I think the only thing that motivates me is my anxiety and guilt. So it is not like I get things done because I'm feeling any optimism about life or a will to live EDIT reading everyone's comments and want to say thank you so much. It is really validating to hear from so many people who relate, and I hope we all are able to find peace in life.

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive Hi y’all, Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them. I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since. I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post. So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her. When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy. She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually. We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other. Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual. But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her. We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life. We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy. When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way. We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence. She was a very funny person as well. She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate when she did something she put her whole heart into it. She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that. But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence. I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter. My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me. She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again. Everyone loved her, literally. She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people. She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive. I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world. We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved. But I cannot bear what happened. We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way. No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh. It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together. On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more. It’s absurd I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself. It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine). I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout. Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown. But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either. I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this. I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey. Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her. People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day. Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me. The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more). I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it. For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer. I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway.",1
"i feel disconnected i feel like i've just been observing my own life rather than living it, if that makes sense. i am stuck in a really stressful situation and i have no way of coping with it. i have tried crying it out but i don't feel sad enough anymore. the only emotions that i've been able to experience recently are anxiety and anger. so much has happened in the past two years that i could literally witness a murder and i dont think it would have an effect on me. everything seems to be losing its meaning to me, even things that would've deeply upset me in the past, or the things that i used to really enjoy and appreciate. i hate whats happening to me. its like theres a ball of dread and uneasiness building up inside and i can't really do anything to stop it.",1
"I called my dad on video and he started crying. I haven't seen him face to face in two years. He told me ""you're so beautiful and successful. Im so proud of you."" He made me cry, too. I didn't have anyone else I can tell this to.",0
"I hate when people say ""life will get better"" I want life to BE better not to GET better, I want it ""better"" NOW, I don't want to wait for fate.

"Halloween All of my overdramatic emotions and expressions, idiosyncrasies, and distorted views of the world can be briefly manifested in the form of cartoon ghosts and skeletons. Bones, orange and black, costumes, spider webs, shitty cartoons and animated movies, stores all decorated with the most corny decorations possible. It's the one season where I can accept my shadow for what it is, and see it as just another cartoon ghoul rather than a death sentence.",1
"Do I have depression Im 13 and been having these problems for 3.5 yrs so I don't know if its just puberty or what but i'm always sad, I can feel happy but not for long. I'm always on the verge of tears and cry for no reason. Every time I look into the mirror I instinctively throw insults at myself. If I don't have a distraction my mind thinks horrible/negative thoughts. I lost my sense of empathy and now i'm just apathetic. Also, I no longer care if I feel any physical pain even if it hurts a lot. And then there's the thoughts about suicide they are more and more frequent. The only thing stopping me from suicide is the fact that I don't to die a minor. So. is this depression or puberty.",1
"I need help, I don't know what to do This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect. I am isolated. I feel like nobody understands. I don't blame anyone for not understand. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want to feel better, to feel connected. I want to care about something other than myself. I don't even know where to begin. I am in a position where I believe there is so much negativity in my life, it effects my internal optimism. the real me is so much different than me. I don't know how to explain that. I don't know if others feel that way too. Theres the 'you' who tries to be compassionate, and caring. But then deep down, there's a different you. I have such a hard time expressing myself because I feel like nobody cares how others feel. You know why I feel like this. I don't care how others feel, well I Kinda do. Let me put it like this. Let's say there is a guy I know called bob. He tells me about his problems, and how hard is life is. I tell him that really sucks, and I understand what I'm going through. And suddenly he feels better, now that he's had someone to vent to. But the reason I'm trying to comfort him is not because I care about his issues, I don't understand the pain he is going through. The reason I comfort him is because I understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving. It makes you feel like your not the only one going through that. But what if that's just what everyone does. That's how i feel about venting. Even though I'm sitting here typing to you, you probably don't care. And even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting, it's not. I don't believe you, I can't honestly believe that, the person you're talking to, that you actually care for that person. I don't know if that's true or not, but my deep down me say's it is true. I've contemplated several reasonings to why I feel so.... I don't know how to describe it. I don't trust anyone but myself. I cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words. When I was growing up, I had terrible parents. No they didn't hit me, or physically abuse me. They didn't play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about. So why do I say there were terrible parents. They weren't there. They were, but they weren't. All I ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed. I remember my dad sitting in his room watching T.V. We never went out. We never vacationed. I don't feel like I know those people. I feel isolated. Once I reached high school things changed a bit. My parent's split to no surprise from anyone. My dad and I lived together and got somewhat closer. I wanted to live with my mom, but my sister did too. And I didn't want my dad to have to live alone. My dad was going through a deep depression at the time. We would both stay home at night. We didn't do anything. I got the new COD black ops. I start skipping school. Nothing feels good, nothing feels right. I just want to play video games, it's the only thing that takes me away. it's the only thing I look forward too. I start skipping more. I never make it to class after lunch anymore. Principal calls my dad to setup a meeting. I've missed over 80 days of school. I'm not going to be a freshman next year. I used to be a straight A student in middle school. I still think I could be. I go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues. Still skipping school. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I hurt. I don't care, I want to escape. We move across the country for a new start. My dad and I move in with his mother. My grandpa recently passed, so she was quite lonely. Also, my dad is a mama's boy for sure, so this helped him out too. I went to a new school, had a new start. I meet somebody the first of day. she came up to me and started talking. this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that. I feel different. I feel confident. Maybe people do like me. Turns out we go to the same church, we're in the same ward, the same classes. She is amazing. I meet another guy, he's so cool. He's extremely outgoing and we also go the same church, the same school, have some of the same classes. Both of them start dating. I am absolutely crushed. I feel alone, I thought i found some people I could connect with, but then puppy love takes over and once again I'm ignored. I meet her best friend. She's kind of cute, and she really likes me. Ok what the hell let's give it a shot. We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it. Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together. One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this. A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her. We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her. She has to meet up with them in a few hours, and they won't be coming home until after that meetup. Uh oh, someone just came home, quick hide next to my bed. I have to leave right now, don't worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too, just leave after they leave. So there I lay, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly the door opens, it's the boyfriend. He checks the room and finds me. He doesn't let me leave, he say's I'm trespassing. I tell him I was invited in and told to hide there. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't let me pass. I try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops. This is bullshit. I push through him and run downstairs to leave. Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her. I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave. I'm saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down. We're half brothers, and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me. I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared. The cop harasses both us, one of us is lying, but we committed no real crime so he let's us go. I say hey let's go smoke some weed with my friend. So I drive his car over to my friends house and we light up. Then we decided to go to my other friends house. So we leave my friends neighborhood. We're being followed, but i didn't realize this at the time. We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared. They start harassing my brother. ""We don't want your kind in this city. Leave and do not come back"". He is black, is that the kind your talking about? are you fucking kidding me right now? do you fucking hear yourself? We're taken into custody and driven to the police station, they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were. No we weren't doing anything wrong, you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city. You harassed us and assumed we had weed on us, despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood. Doesn't matter, I have a plane ticket and I'm already leaving. I arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact I reached out to earlier. We're in similar positions, he's a year older just moved to Chicago. He's very forward about the fact that he is homosexual.we'll call him bradley. Okay no problem. I figure he realizes I'm not interested. He offers me a place to stay with im for $300. Perfect, that's all I have. I get a job at a local pizza place, it's perfect cause I can make tips to help me until next paycheck. Now I have no money. Turns out it's not his house, but we're sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago. the other people are great, but they hate bradley. bradley is a douche. bradley suggest I might be a closet homosexual. He will have sex with me if I want, but he let's me know he would be the top. He tells other people that I'm actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19. He tells other people I'm hiding my homosexuality. He constantly describes homo sex to me. I don't want to hear about it. I tell him I don't care who he likes, what gender he is, I don't want to hear about his sex life. He continues to harass me sexually. I ask the other roommates if I can take the extra room upstairs, I'll pay for a fair share of the rent. They all hate bradley and they agree. It's a shitty house, and I want to move out. I want to move closer to work. I isolate myself further, all these new people, this is a new life. I'm on my own now. Nobody is going to help me. I find a roommate and we get a small apt to share. I quit the pizza place after some bullshit that I'm over with. Bad management that blames the staff for everything. Just one example there was a busy Wednesday night where I was the only server. The ice cream machine breaks and I'm usually the one to fix it. I don't have time as I am serving everyone. I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts. Long story short, his wife told me she didn't have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck. fuck you bitch, you don't deserve me as an employee and I walk out. I then find the job opportunity of my life, a web design firm is hiring. Okay awesome, let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills. I walk in to the interview, everything is brand new, everyone is dressed super nice, everyone is super young. I start and 3 days after being hired, my supervisor is fired for nodding out. I should've seen this sign and left right then and there. The owner starts talking to me more and more. He gives me special jobs, and has talks with me all the time. It's clear he is doing some sort of drugs. Over the next few months, and many raises later things start going really downhill. This guy starts playing mind games with everyone. Someone is stealing is leads. Someone is always out to get him. He want's to know who is stabbing him in the back. He set's up elaborate traps to catch people in the act. He ends up accusing me of stealing leads. That's impossible, I would never do that. He set's it up so that I end up blaming another one of his top guys. But if you look at all the evidence HE PLANTED, he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads. So then he accuses me because of the accusations I made about his TOP guy. This is some bullshit. He calls me that night because he want's me to admit to it. I go off him, I've never felt so betrayed in my life, I told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him. He just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy. He say's it's gonna be ok, and he forgives me. He just want's me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over. NO FUCK YOU, it wasn't me. go fuck yourself. He contacts me the next day when I don't show up for work. He says come hangout with me, I just want to talk. We go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account. Everything is going fine, I'm explaining to him how betrayed i felt. He apologizes and says it won't happen again. Then he decides he will take me home. He pulls over the side of the road on the way home, and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs, and 2 lines of cocoa. Snorts that shit right up. on the side of the fucking road. I feel unsafe, I want to leave this company, never see this guy again. And I do leave, fuck this industry. I want to make my own company. And what do you know, I isolate myself deeper. I can't trust anybody, they will just end up fucking you. I get 3 other friends together as business partners. The only way I can describe the next 6 months, is us 'pretending' to be a company. It's like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends. We had meetings, and sale pitches, and presentations to potential clients, but we never actually did any 'real' nitty gritty work. We played company for six months, took in over $40k and spent all of it. Every customer charged back on us for not doing anything, and that company went bankrupt very quickly. At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done. So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been? You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject. Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone. I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying. I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone. If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me. I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me. ",1
"how to bury the hatchet? I'm getting really stressed over certain stuff IRL and the only outlet to ask about it or do anything really to socialize is reddit, so. Im in a lot of things that I dont want to describe as precarious but are certainly really busy and kind of unpredictable and its all getting to be too much recently even though, ironically, I think I just got out of the storm and now am in a blind spot where things are healthier for just a minute. I can relax but relaxing is making me stress out, I tried laying in bed for a few days and just doing various hobbies and junk but its not working, so, I guess Ill just keep posting to reddit and hope it works out? Posting to reddit is good anyway, it gets people talking. maybe, who knows, ill help someone else with my needing of help! Although I guess my original question here would be me wondering if sometimes its better to call something done and quits and pack up and leave, but, thats a bit of a rhetorical question as for me I know the answer is no. but even if I wont be changing my mind I think hearing peoples advice would still be helpful! Just having other people to talk to is very nice, or at the least listening to me ramble XD so thank you! Thats all.",1

"Probably I got myself to the point of burn out? This has been going on for at least one month. I have a really big trouble focusing on my homework , I have to really push myself to get things done. Most of the times I'm too tired, I feel like I've done a marathon or something like that and because of that I don't have any motivation to do something productive with my time. This has also affected my sleep, like I've started sleeping also in middays, which is something I never did.

"I’m drained from the constant changes in life Last year, I had a job in a profession that I really loved and I had a girlfriend who loved me. I’m in my late 20’s so I felt that maybe I can live a quiet, stable life with a women I love. I was completely over the 20something lifestyle of partying, hooking-up and just the aimlessness in general. For the first time ever, I was excited for the future. Fast forward to today and I had to quit the job because the specific workplace was toxic and the women I loved left me because her own mental health issues got the best of her. I don’t even know what else to write. Before the found the job and the girlfriend, I was lost, lonely and severely depressed. The depression never fully went away, but it began to feel like things were beginning to fall into place. I’m just so goddamn sick of the constant chaos in this world. Why can’t I live a peaceful life? Why does that seem to be a crime in this day and age?",1
"Feeling I need to vent about life in general I just feel like I need to vent. I'm 31 and currently living with my narc mom. After covid hit I lost my job and out of desperation made the choice to move back. I have both an autoimmune disorder (lupus) and currently dealing with major depression. The combination of the two means that I deal with lots of fatigue, and that a lot of times I don't really strongly feel like doing much of anything, though I do force myself to get outside and I'm functional enough to I take care of the basic needs like daily hygiene and buying and making food for myself. Recently it has just been feeling very oppressive. I'm in sort of a paradoxical position where I wish I wasn't all alone all the time (I don't really have any local friends) yet the depression keeps me from wanting to go and hang out with people. I have anhedonia which means I don't really feel positive emotions such as joy and love, but I am able to feel negative emotions such as frustration, hurt, and anger. I struggle with self hate and when its at its worst I feel like I hate almost everyone. I've been living in the same small town city now for about 15 years. I know it wouldn't cure my depression but honestly a lot of times I wish I could just see different scenery. I'm currently working on my master's in teaching, when I first started out I felt on top of the world, and then right after my first semester the major depression hit after a mental breakdown. Being on medication has helped and I've been able to get better since the initial breakdown, but now I'm left worrying how am I going to have the motivation to make it through the rest of the program. I'm tired and sometimes all I want to do is just sleep.",1
"Can stress cause Rapid Aging? I’ve noticed for the past 8 months or so that I am rapidly aging. I’ve aged significantly, since than. It looks like I lost volume in my face and a lot of wrinkles is this normal? Ive been very stressed",1
"I feel like I live for grades. Honestly I don’t know when, how and why it started, but I have extreme fear I will fail. My parents are cool about it, nobody puts pressure in me, but I’m the one who says that I can’t fail in any way. Online school has really messed with me, I started cheating on tests(something I would NEVER do back in 2019), not because I didn’t study, but bcs I don’t trust or believe in myself. When I finish all exams I feel like there is no reason to exist, so I start studying even if the tests are 2 months later. I’ve been living this cicle for 16 years, and I’m tired of living, I constantly feel like dying is the only way I can rest. It sounds childish, I know, but every time I have to do an exam I start being anxious about it and think I won’t get a good grade, so I end up getting desperate.",1
"Feeling Beaten Today started so well and has ended so poorly. My wife went to enrol on her college course today and did so only for a few hours later the college to basically pull the plug on this plan by denying us the funding for childcare that we need for her to be able to attend her course. We are on benefits here in the UK as she raises our little boy whilst I go out and work full time as a teaching assistant so on low wages. I'm enrolled on an open university masters that starts in October and she was going to go and do hairdressing at college. This was supposed to be the start of us working our way out of the not so great financial situation we have. In a few years I would have my masters and be able to pursue a career working with children like I've always wanted to that earns me far more money than I currently do. My wife was going to be able to do her dream of being a TA for the part time hours most TA jobs offer and be a hairdresser on the side to earn a bit more money for us. This was going to be the better life we had always wanted and always wanted for our two children and allow us to have a third if we wanted one. But the college pulling the plug has just crushed us both. Her because it means she can't do the course she wants to do and better herself the way she wants to. And me because it feels I've sunk into this rut of thinking that whenever we try to look forward and be optimistic and things seem to be going well for us it all comes crashing down around us and falls through. I can't shake this feeling that no matter how positive and optimistic we can get, it's always going to fall apart. I can't shake this feeling that no matter how hard we try, we're not going to be able to get out of a benefits system I'm beginning to feel like we're trapped in. This really sucks",1
"I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time. I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples. I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called. Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh. Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this? I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",1

"When Does Ideation Become a Risk for an Attempt? I’ve always had suicidal ideation, and it fluctuates occasionally between a reassuring last resort, and a constant overwhelming obsession. I’m currently looking for a psychiatrist, but in the meantime I’m often concerned that I might be slowly drifting towards an actual attempt. I know it’s impossible to give me advice comparable to someone actually sitting down and working with me, but I would like to hear from people who have attempted suicide or people who have worked with those who have ideation or tendencies. How or when did you know you or your patient was officially an immediate risk to themselves? Thank you for any words and advice.",1

"Experiencing depression after high school So I started college a week ago and virtually every single day has gotten worse and worse. Nothing bad at all about the college itself, but my head is all fucked up. To start my story, I was a pretty big deal in high school. Homecoming king, sports/ class president, the whole nine yards. Thought I had something to prove so I went away 4 hours to college while all my friends went to CC in my hometown. After graduation I fell into a slump for about a week but was still playing baseball/ hanging out with my friends so I got out of it and was doing good. Not anymore. Every day I go to class, eat and play xbox by myself until night. Every single night I lay up and think about how good life was for 4 years and then start to realize that life is in the past and gone forever. I start thinking about what I would do with another go at HS, all the things I miss and if I should’ve stayed home where I was comfortable. I haven’t really had issues with thinking about self harm, its just like theres a constant cloud over my head and no matter what I do the reality of my situation always makes things worse. Hoping someone in this sub has been through this and has some advice Hoping this makes sense",1
"How do I recover my creativity after stress? Don't know if this is the right place for this, but I've searched other subs and this seems like the best place to me. I've been through a lot of stress and maybe some undiagnosed depression in the last two years, between the death of a close loved one, job and financial stress, severe relationship problems, health issues, and a bad living situation. I existed just to go to work where my coworkers helped me de-stress and laugh, but slept until I had to leave and came home just to get in bed again. I'm a creative person with a lot of drive to make things, and this used to give me a lot of purpose in my life, but during this time I'd stopped doing almost anything but watching comedy specials on TV. I was finally on the upswing of all that and feeling more like myself, and finally got back into my writing, which is my passion. But my stress threshold is still fucked up so when, in March, I felt forced to quit my sewing job over a heated argument/fight with my boss, it broke me again. Not as bad as last year, but I lost the routine I'd just settled into, and most of the writing drive I had I've lost. I worked there for six years and had a strong role and responsibilities that I had integrated as part of my identity. That job felt like ""who I am"". I had a comfortable, lax second job already that's now my main income and I'm fine there, and once again starting to come back out of that darkness. I'm able to do some crafting in bed but still spend most of my time with the TV on. I'm also getting a gentle morning routine going and that helps. But the big problem is my creative drive. I WANT to create things. I'm investing money in a voice recording set up and I want to narrate, and write and read. I'm wasting time cross stitching for hours every night while I binge shows I don't really care about. When I have perfect chunks of time to do the things I crave getting back into, the motivation isn't there. How do I do it? How do I get back into things I love when I've finally reached the other side of the stress? And, how do get myself strong again after so much, so that the next thing to come along doesn't break me all over again?",1
"I thought going back to work would make me motivated and my depression get better...made it worse. Now I feel trapped. Back to being a Nurse again after taking a 1 year from having my daughter.

I can shine at work and be proud of myself, now all I feel is like I'm making mistakes at work,brain fog and the weight of depression on me is greater than it was. The plan did not work and I want out. What the hell. Love helping others and being caring and I feel nothing. Got home and just drank wine. No food. I don't deserve to eat. I feel like a failure to all of those around me, my mental health is declining and I don't know how much I can continue.",1
"Alone..TW I(f15) feel very alone lately. I mean, I have friends yeah… but I don’t have anyone that I trust enough to really confide in, to tell the things in my head. I feel like most my friends would just be like “haha same, that sucks though.” I dunno though. The only one I feel like I could really confide in is in the mental hospital right now, he has been for the past month. I feel really lost. I want to cut myself up so badly. I’m not stable. I need help. I don’t know what to do. My head is so mean to me. Everyday it’s just “Kill yourself you worthless bitch. Fucking whore. You’re so fat stop eating. Kill yourself. Cut yourself. They all hate you. You deserve to die.” I’m so sick of it. I’m so tired all of the time and no one understands why. It’s so frustrating.. I know I’m not okay. I worry what I’m going to do to myself, I don’t feel safe. I want to cut my whole body up so badly. I could at least get away with cutting up my chest, my family never sees there. I’m so tempted. There’s no one keeping me from it. Am I just calling out into the void? Does anyone care? Do I want them to care? Should I kill myself? Should I cut myself? No, no, yes, yes. Those are the answers I come up with. Yet..I know that my mind probably can’t be trusted. It’s not the most reliable source. I think I’m crazy. Somebody please help me..",1
"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist. It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present. Edit I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down.

"First home stress I never really knew real stress. Sure, in high tension moments I’ve been stressed out. That never lasts long for me though. I’m an easy going guy and I try to be rational about life. I move into my new home on 7/15 and the closer it gets the more stressed out I get. Today I snapped at my 6 y/o son for asking for a popsicle... I cried for about 5 minutes in the shower after that. I sat him down and apologized then talked to my wife on her lunch break and almost broke down again. I miss her when she works 12 hour shifts. I’m doing all the packing myself and taking care of our kids and two Husky/Shepherds (both are just over 1 y/o). I’m afraid this won’t go away and that I’ll be on edge like this for a long time and possible forever. I quit smoking weed about two months ago to get a better job (this plays into my stress too, I love my current job at a used bookstore! Probably love weed more.) and I haven’t had a cigarette in over a year.

How do I relax without getting drunk or high and get all the things done?",1
"Falling back into severe depression, with responsibilities. Hello friends, Throwaway for reasons. I really needed a place to let this out besides therapy. I’ll try to keep specifics to a minimum as my social circle browses the subreddit occasionally and isn’t something I’m currently sharing with all of them. A short backstory Ever since high school I’ve suffered from various severities of depression, this peaked in 2018/2019 when I attempted to take my own life on two occasions and (luckily) failed both times without serious repercussions health wise. Fast forward a year or two, I have a child with a woman who I am no longer with, and fatherhood has been absolutely amazing. I know it’s cliche, but it really is life changing. I wouldn’t give it up for anything. While things have been mostly civil with coparenting as you can imagine issues arise more often than with a couple who is together. I’ve really tried to let things roll off and keep things as positive as I can for the kiddos sake, but the last couple months those old feelings have started to sneak back in - especially when there is some kind of conflict with the mother. I find myself in a very guilt ridden situation, I feel awful whenever the thoughts of taking my life creep back in especially when I am a father now. I always push them down out of pure guilt for thinking them, because I love my child and cannot imagine life away/without them. In a lot of ways, it’s worse than before because I always told myself I had a way out - and I feel like I do not have that option anymore (rightly). Has anyone else dealt with this? I know I’m not alone in the world, and my feelings are not entirely unique. I just needed to get it out somewhere, it helps. Thanks for listening.",1
"Stress is affecting my sleep. I have been waking up at 2 30 in the morning in the last two weeks. If I am lucky, I've slept 4 hours. Then I am up and down for the rest of the night. Apparently, I am having night terrors where I am fighting and yelling in the hours that I do sleep. I didn't know that. That generally only happens when I am very stressed out. Does anyone have any hints on what I can do before going to sleep that will relax me enough to sleep through the night?",1
"I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. Ever since I was little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me. My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again. Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down. I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation. Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this. He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show. What will the cops do about it when they come?",1
I feel like suicide is inevitable Not that I want to kill myself right this instant but it feels like it's too late to prevent it. Something bad is going to happen later on down the line and then I'll just end it. There's no way around it so long as I don't die suddenly in a car crash or something. I feel like I'm one of those people who just never gets better. Edit why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post Edit 2 why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes Edit 3 I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now. This is why I feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally.,1
"My daughter learned how to ride a bike yesterday. Thus 4th of July weekend I started trying to teach my kid how to ride a bike with no training wheels.

I could tell she wasn't having fun and I was frustrated with myself because I could tell I wasn't being a very good teacher. So Saturday I did some research and watched a few videos trying to get some tips to help her figure it out. Yesterday we tried again and she got it!

"Can't take much more.. Long post, short rope to hold on to. Pseudo chronological order. The pandemic is a minor player in this. I am a mature adult, financially ok, grown children & grands, decent job, wonderful wife, nice house. The setting is wonderful. The plot since July needs a serious rewrite. One of my sibling had dementia and her child said multiple times to multiple official people that she wanted to kill her mother. I filed for guardianship, and it drug on until last month. My niece was successful - she starved my sister to death. Adult protective services, the judge, the lawyers, none of them took my niece seriously. I am devastated- I should have pressed the attorney more, been more assertive. My remaining siblings aren't talking to me. During this time frame of July - May, 3 of my dogs have died from unrelated causes- cancer, adverse reaction to heartworm treatment, and pool accident. My wife had a cancerous polyp in her colon removed, now she has a dubious image on her recent mammogram. I just found out today that my position at my job is not being renewed so I have a job until June, but unsure of what the future holds. Additionally, a grandchild was born at the end of 2020. My son and DIL know only what their doctor and the internet say. For the first two months, the baby didn't gain weight ,and didn't sleep, My DIL was breast feeding and took caffeine pills at the same time. The pediatrician never asked my DIL about caffeine, so it was never brought up. Additionally, the baby wasn't given enough milk/formula. After fretting and telling my son about the effects of caffeine and then about the amount of food, now my grandchild is fat and sassy, but my son tells me he doesn't want to waste the formula so only small bottles are made for each feeding. So here I am tonight, as every night, stressed, tense, can't sleep without prescription intervention, sex is a faint memory. I truly don't know how much more I can have put on my plate and still stay mentally stable. I tried a daily anxiety exercise but it was just 1 more thi g to have to remember to do each day. Thanks for coming to my condensed version of hell. Any thoughts on what to do to help handle this are welcome.",1
Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable? I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it. ,1
"Gawd! Do I really annoy people that quickly I can just tell when someone doesn’t want to talk to me anymore like it’s SOOOO OBVIOUS. I’ve been through that type of shiz a gazillion times. All I just want is someone who genuinely cares what I have to say and we can actually talk about anything, make each other laugh (I’m bad at sharing memes) but no..I should remember that we don’t live in a perfect world",0
"Head Pressure and Weird Symptoms For the last 3 months I have had a constant pressure in my head along with strained/tired eyes, brain fog, dizziness and lightheadedness. The same time this started, I was extremely stressed and for most of the 3 months I’ve had it, I have been very stressed and anxious in part due to not knowing what was causing my symptoms. Can prolonged stress/anxiety cause these symptoms and has anyone experienced this. If so, what medication do you recommend. Thanks",1
"Nothing gives me more stress than school I feel it physically, constantly, and it’s only worse when I procrastinate but I procrastinate because I physically can’t do it. And then I turn in things late and I’m sure this is going to be bad for my grade. I’m trying to tell myself it hardly matters but I feel constant physical exhaustion. I just want a night of sleep. I can’t handle all of this at once and should not have taken this many hard classes. I wish I could stop beating myself up.",1
"How fast can your body recover from long lasting chronic stress? Sooooo. I’m on vacation now. The last couple of weeks and months (well it started getting really bad in June), I’ve been having A LOT of stress, well my whole body got out of balance. I have constant stomache issues, I either have no appetite or I could eat my whole kitchen, my body feels heavy I have gained a lot of weight (well not necessarily because I’ve been eating more, but because my body saves too much water)... My skin looks terrible. My hair is falling out. I’ve been having panic attacks on a daily basis, sleeping problems, and cannot concentrate at all........ Sooooo now I can feel that my body is finally able to calm down a bit. Meditation, Sports and the good weather is really helping a lot. I will also try going to therapy now, which I’m sure will help me in the future. Now I wonder... how fast can my body recover? How long will it take to feel balanced again, after months of complete madness... (?) I really have a lot of stuff going on and I need my body to function again... Is there an answer to that? Looking forward to your comments )) thanks",1

Teacher I don't know if I can handle my job anymore. The district and principal demand too much. They treat us all like underlings. We work closest with the students but are not allowed to give any input on what we see and have an intelligent discussion about it. I woke up last night with wild heart palpitations. It really concerned me. Someone told me that everywhere is like this. Is this true for you all?,1

"I feel like I'm watching my life crash and I can't stop it This all started in October. I lost my mom on the 11th, that alone is still hard to deal with. She was my rock, my person to run to when I was stressed or couldn't figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult. There were understandably missed days of work, which caused lost wages. Only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days, none were covered for him. This caused us to fall back on a few bills. We live on a tight budget as it is, there was no insurance for mom, so no way to financially put back our wages. It started a slow spiral littered with late fees. And then came early December where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car, we lost our car. Luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car. But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work. but I work the overnight. No one is willing to help me get there and home. We have called taxi services around us. It would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me. This is crazy and I'm so nervous. Everything at once, I'm worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head, we gave up our car to keep. No matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years, both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything. We make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives. I'm just on the edge and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know, who could help isn't around to help us. Thanks for listening well reading I guess.",1
"My 2 best friends together while I'm in the other class. 1 week ago, our school sent an Email to us telling us in wich classroom we would be. I've learned that my 2 best friends were in 216 class while I would be in 217. I don't have a purpose for school anymore, and it's destroying me. Being aways from them is really hard to deal with and I don't know what to do.",1
"I’m worried I’m going to disappoint my family I don’t really know where to turn and I’m running out of options. I’m in Med school, abroad, and am embroiled in trying to earn a few more points on a major exam so that I can attend my sister’s wedding, which is to be held in the States. The exam I failed has a make up, but it is literally scheduled the day after the wedding, so to travel back abroad still means I would have to miss out on the occasion, which itself can’t be delayed any further. I know that I am not the strongest of students, but I really felt confident with the particular exam, and now because of my own damn fault I may be withheld from going. I just feel like I’m letting everyone down, like I’m just destined to keep failing. It’s hard to talk to people close to me on this matter, despite me doing so, because it just goes back into this loop of “you did this to yourself, you need to dedicate more time to studying, etc.” I don’t disagree with the feedback, but it’s not helping me right now. I just feel trapped. Update well, I tried. I went to the University office, and it was such a farce. They stopped any conversation saying “Their hands are tied,” or “we are legally bound from doing ...”, including providing the answer key to said exam so that I could see where the points were lost. I won’t be attending my sister’s wedding, and will have to sit in for the make up exam. I never minded sitting for the exam, it’s just the timing of it all. I could go on about how pathetic the scheduling system is, how I can’t even access the exam admit card until a few days prior to the exam, but it’s not going to do me any good. Wish me luck on this exam please. You’ve all been very kind. As for my family, of course they are understanding of the situation. I just feel horrible letting them down.",1
"This year.. How many of y'all have had an exceptionally crappy year? Just a series of unfortunate events nonstop ? I've always had anxiety issues and will literally not sleep or eat until a problem is at least subdued if not resolved. Yet I've also been very very adept at avoiding nonsense and misery in general. All up until this year. It started with covid making life a bit difficult. We a share that issue though. A bit later in the year a very close family member attempts suicide and that alone brought so many issues that lasted a few months. After that episode my 8 year old cat, my best little dude ,passed away due to severe anemia, and i spent 3k of my savings trying to save him.. Now i have what potentially could be a blood disorder ,if not possible (maybe future) leukemia. Family members have had that shit.. I've slept maybe 10 hours in the last 3 days. And for the first time in years I'm terrified and also for the first time in a long time i broke down in tears for a few hours earlier wishing my cat was here. I miss the fuck out of him. I live by the moto ""it could always be worse ""but now this time it seems it probably will GET worse. This year seems to get weirder and weirder. I had so many plans set for this year. I wanted to get a house, take my cat out for car rides more, get a better job , get a home gym ,run more , fix my truck up , go out with friends and maybe find a woman to share my time with. All of that snuffed out and it took my cat with it. I'm in my late 20s and I bust my ass of for my health and wellness and now even that is under heavy threat. I'm definitely not the only one with these issues. I probably have it great to some of you. It sure does seem odd that this all happens this year though as if darkness is catching up. How are y'all doing?...",1

"Super depressed from covid changes- single, lonely, no friends now Prior to covid I was living with roommates in a city. I always had friends to go out and do whatever with. I work in a hospital so I continued to work during Covid. My one roommate moved home to save money working from home and another moved in with her boyfriend. We were all 26/27 at the time. I moved in myself and it is so isolating. Post quarantine all of my friends have moved in with boyfriends or gotten engaged. I now just turned 29 and feel so dumb. My friends don’t go out anymore because they’re all in relationships. Yet on the rare occasions I do see my friends I’m always asked why I’m not out at the bars etc trying to meet new people…. with what friends???? Maybe I’m just jealous that everyone’s life is better than mine but I just don’t see things getting better from here. Not a fan of dating apps so I just feel stuck.",1

People are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help.

Police in my country don't usually carry firearms, and they were genuinely v nice. Just thought it was unnecessary escalation. They offered to take me to hospital. My depressive episodes are sporadic enough that I can be lucid about them after but while I'm in them my mind is v numb and all I can think of is 'why am I here', and I can't answer.

They yell at me a couple of times a week for dumb shit such as not answering my phone when I am 1 room away from them.

"Can someone just tell me what does stress and anxiety actually mean ? Okay so as the title says can y'all define stress and anxiety. Also is anxiety related to being too curious everytime, thinking or daydreaming every now and then about something that you like. Basically I'm a 19 yo lean guy who just keeps dreaming in my own fantasy world...lol...and always be in the mood of being curious about certain things or just keep daydreaming whatever I like. Can this lead to stress ? Cause I've recently cought a cold for over a month !! (usually it used to go within 3 days to a week's span) and have been getting a bit of stomach aches from about a bit more than a week, and also have been feeling as if my stomach is full and my digestion has slowed down.

"Working three jobs and slowly losing my mind At the moment, I am working three jobs and slowly but surely it is getting to be too much for me. I am a Salesforce Administrator at a university by day, then work as an actor in the evenings at a professional theatre, and also work as the Business Manager at a different theatre company. I love each of these jobs in their own ways and consider all of them to be great opportunities for my professional development. The SFDC admin job is a great career opportunity and pays the bills. Acting is my passion and what I really want to be doing in life, but work is sporadic and sometimes doesn't pay well. I am getting my MBA right now too (but on a break because I'm working on a show) so that is why I am passionate about being a Business Manager. Unfortunately, the Business Manager gig doesn't pay but it is great experience. On top of the stress I feel because of the amount of work I'm doing, I also have a commute that is at least 30-45 minutes one way in heavy traffic. Furthermore, I hate the company I work for full-time but by working there I get my MBA for free. Needless to say there is a lot going on in my life right now and I don't really want to quit any of it. However, I am realizing that this is not sustainable and something has to give. I calculated it the other day and I am working around 80 hours a week at least. I would greatly appreciate advice on how to release stress and also advice on how to do everything I want to and still maintain my sanity. TL;DR I have too many jobs but am passionate about all of them. How do I deal with the large amount of stress and/or figure out how to manage all of this.",1

"My mom keeps laughing at me whenever I get upset So today I got really upset because my mom called the electric company a long time ago and they came today about our bill, my mom denied it was us who called. He asked the other neighbors and he was asking for the apartment that called them about the bill, he said that they had low income so they were trying to see if they can figure out what to do with the bill or something along those lines. (So my mom tried telling them that after using the heater ONCE in the winter, the bill was $300) After hearing that, I told my Mom about it. We have low income because my mom is the only one working and she doesn’t have her green card yet, our dad also left us so it’s harder for her to clean houses for money. So anyways I told my mom that we could’ve saved money. She said it doesn’t matter, I told her that I know that my mom can’t earn money. That’s why I always try to find ways to save money. I’m only 12 and Im aware going through puberty so I get mad easily. I was shouting back, asking her why she never tried to save money. She doesn’t respond and starts laughing at me, I’ve been getting stressed out a lot this past week and my mom just doesn’t help. She laughs whenever I get stressed, she tries to communicate to others about useless things with her extremely broken English, and she keeps using her money on useless things. Overall I’m fine with all the other things but I just get way more stressed when my mom keeps laughing at me when I get upset. It is unlikely for me not to start crying when she starts laughing. She then starts laughing at me even more, I’m having second thoughts on her being a nice person. I’m starting to think that she bullied others, all I know is that my mom fought with other kids to be at a “higher level” of a clique, a leader, I remember her telling me about a mark on her back from fighting. I know I went off topic a bit while typing this but I’m just really annoyed that my mom laughs at my stress and calls me insane for shouting. I’ve tried many times, asking her not to laugh at me while I’m stressed out, it never works. I have no idea how to make her stop, I was wondering if anyone could suggest anything to make my mom listen. ",1
"Multiple Streams of Life My problem lately seems to be having multiple streams of conscience or multiple personalities that's fueling my depression. One minute I'm full of faith and don't you dare pull me away from that, the next it's ""this is all crap and I'm bisexual"". I keep seeming to flip personalities between a spiritual person who's full of life and love to give others, and a cynical sexual deviant. Sometimes I'm not even either one of those. It becomes easier I think to get depressed when I'm going through one of these episodes and I just smile and keep going. Please tell me there's a way out of this maze. No one can tell me how I'm feeling, but right now I'm so overwhelmed I don't know which voice in my head is the right one.",1

At night I lay in bed just thinking after another which makes me feel I'm getting sucked into a black hole. Like when in theaters, they have that one sound effect which makes me feel exactly that. It's hard to explain. But it's been 7 months since the official break up and I'm still having a hard time. It's getting better though. Little by little.

How do i know if i'm actually stressing out and how much i'm stressing out? right now i don't what's called stress or panic but i'm worried about my future along with where and what i want to do about college and the fact that i haven't taken my SATs yet and i'm still studying for my permit and the fact that i'm in junior year doing all that along with the fact that my classes give me a shit load of hw. all i do is hw everyday and have straight A's and maintain a 4.3 GPA but i feel like that's not enough. i feel like shit and i feel like a failure that it's making me sweat and like i can't breathe when i think about this stuff. how do i cope and take it one step at a time?,1
"Broke up with my (M23) ex (F23) exactly a year ago and I still can’t seem to cope with the reality and move forwards. So I’m not sure if my story would fit the motif of this sub but I can’t seem to find any other places that would help me otherwise, hopefully this would be the place. My ex and I broke up at the end of August exactly one year ago after being in a relationship for two years. We shared the same friend group, studied in the same department, had affections for each other and what meant to happen, happened. Now, I was not a great partner by any mean even though she was everything to me and I blame myself every single day for letting it happen, I completely understood her decision for dumping my ass; it just hurt so much that even after one year, I still can’t move forwards. The whole shenanigan happened during my senior year and it certainly affected my dissertation work very badly. For a few months afterwards, I managed to push myself and come to school regularly to work on my thesis (I worked in a lab for my thesis statement). There were many other issues, parts of it due to the fact that I was not into the academic by any means and I had skipped a whole year previously to work part time jobs just because I disliked the subject so much; this gap year specifically and the differences in academic motivation were big reasons why she dumped me. The other was seeing her and her new partner (she found someone else immediately afterwards, in the same faculty that we were in) on a daily basis and it just hurt my weak ass so much that I would not be able to concentrate at all for the rest of the day. So in order to distract myself from the facts, mostly, I found myself using tinder (it’s kind of a meme where I’m from) hopefully to find a friend, a partner of some sorts. This was going on for a few months, having met a couple of really nice girls, before I realized I was no good to them and what I was doing is selfish and unhealthy, so better off just to keep the affliction to myself and not put it on other people. Now moving forwards, because of that realization in addition with my suffering in school, I decided to quit school entirely, hopefully to come back someday; quit my part time job, not like I was able to work properly anyway; and found myself stuck inside for the past 7 months or so. I also stopped chatting and seeing my friends all together. I share a small friend group of 10, 11 people in college with my ex and that’s about it (I studied high school abroad so no bff around, I’m a dumbbell at keeping contacts as well). She is a regular chatter and I can’t put myself in any further emotional pain, especially when she suddenly decides to talk about her now partner in our group. Now, I’m not an outgoing individual and ever since my failure at studying abroad (I love medicine and was hoping to continue studying abroad after high school, but failed to do so due to financial issues so I’m back in my country doing the complete opposite of what I like), I started to develop a mild condition of depression, it came to my ex’s recognition too but she wanted nothing to deal with it. It finally crossed the line after the break up, in addition to all the stress I got from school and family. I sought a diagnosis earlier this year and was on medication for a few months, though having known the conditions of mental health support in my country and the financial situation my family is in, I relied on the medication alone and it has not helped just one bit. I realize this has been quite a rant and some of you may call me weak, which I agree a hundred and ten percents btw. I just helplessly felt the need to let this pain off my chest and hopefully get some advices in return but otherwise, I truly appreciate your reading and maybe, somehow I can manage to get myself together in the near future, if not, then it was nice knowing you all ). tl;dr high school goals shattered due to financial problem, back to Nam; disliked college and the chosen academic; found a girl, broke up due to differences in academic motivation; fell into depression and have been self-locked inside ever since, found ways to distract myself but to no avail; cut off all contacts and medication is not helping.

"Don’t know what’s wrong with me Ok I’m sorry to have to just rant but I’m dealing with so much right now, I’ve been with my gf for 5+ years, we’ve had our ups and downs and my depression has slightly gotten worse the past few years making me job hop because I panic and give up, I left my recent job due to just not feeling good and just dreading it because it was taking time away from my gf and the dogs. We live in our own and my gfs parents are always hounding me about my “work ethic” which I know it’s bad but it wasn’t always like that just since my depression took over again. Needless to say my gf went to visit them the other day and we told no one so they didn’t hound her and I well they ask her how my work was going and said not to lie because they new. Now the only thing we can figure is they went out of their way and called or visited the store just to find a reason to hound me. I don’t won’t to lose my gf but I feel at this point they’re just doing their best to torment me and make my mentality more worse.",1
"I feel helpless and alone. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 10 years old. It is now 12 years later, and it still has a hold on me. I can’t seem to shake it, the intrusive thoughts and random outbursts of anger or agony. For so long, I tried to pretend like nothing was wrong with me. I lied to doctors about my mental state, I plastered a smile on my face when I knew I was dying inside. I tried to ignore the bullies, and act like they didn’t affect me. I graduated high school and watched my classmates attend their dream colleges. I watched them get into loving relationships. I watched them graduate college, and obtain their dream jobs in the blink of an eye. I continue to watch them as they live a life I could only wish to have. My few friends haven’t talked to me in months. My family does more fighting and yelling than acting like a real family. I want to leave. I want to get away from here, but I don’t know how. I don’t have enough money. I don’t have anyone to turn to. Every single day, I feel more and more helpless. Like no matter what I do, my life will never get better. Sometimes I think I’m one of the unlucky people that don’t deserve a happy ending. It’s unfair. I’m sick of people telling me I need to find my happiness and be more positive. I can’t. It’s not that easy. I cant be positive when every part of me wants to give up. I’m lost, and my biggest fear is that I always will be.",1

being depressed I am 15 being a teen is so hard you surfer a lot as I am now. Every day I promise myself I won't shout at my parents but every day something happens that makes me mad and I don't know I just start yelling at my family and being an Indian is also not easy you get to hear a lot I mean a lot. it's so hard to tell your parents about what you going through just because they won't understand. even my sister is 23 and she wants me to be like her she was raised in India that's why she is better as I am being raised in Canada that's different. my parents think that all I do on phone is use social media but no I have other work too and whenever I tell them they just say we know what you doing.

"What do I do It all seems so pointless. I've been feeling this way for 6 years. Ive wanted to die the whole time.

I just feel like such a little bitch. I have such an easy life but I'm still here feeling sorry for myself. My self esteem is fine. I have plenty of people to reach out to. I can't place any sort of finger on my stresser, or why I'm depressed. And still there's just literally nothing I want from life anymore, I have no enjoyment from literally anything. Everything I was looking forwards to throughout all last year has finally come and it all made me feel nothing. I just simply don't enjoy living anymore.

"Am I a bad friend/person? First sorry for my English, some grammar might be wanky. Secondly I recently stuggle a lot because I live alone for the first time in my life in a new town, where I know no one. And lastly are my thoughts and feelings all over the place because I think I might have undiagnosed ADHD and Anxiety, or maybe I am just weird, I don't know. I recently got in contact with a very good friend of mine, with whom i didn't talk with for over a year (let's call him Ben). He was/is one of my best friends. I introduced him to my female best friend (lets call her Alex), the first person in my life that understands me so well and shares so many interest with me. We all share a common intrest in video games (PC) and play together often, almost daily. They both recently broke up with their SO and I immediately felt that Ben had a thing for Alex, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Once, I confessed to him that I had a crush on him a long time ago and that I wouldn't be aversed if he would feel the same someday, knowing fully well that I was in the never ending friendzone, but I was glad that I told him anyway. Alex also was part of that conversation, but I don't think she really cared, because they started dating 2 weeks later without me knowing. While playing with them and talking with them on discord, I felt the tension between them, tbh at that time I thought they might make a really cute couple, they were sweet to each other and they had so much in common.....but I was more afraid of what would happen once they started going out....would there still be space for me? what happens if they break up, will I lose Ben again?...... I asked Ben if he had feelings for her, because it was kinda obvious, but he didn't want to admit it at first because of my confession a few weeks back, but I assured him, that even if I had a crush on him right now my feelings wouldn't matter if they loved each other....or so I thought.... A day later my mood dropped, I cried and talked to Alex about it...that I even wished that the two of them never met, because I feel like losing them and especially her. She was really considered and assured me, that she would always be there for me and that I am the first friend she ever felt so connected with. I was happy but felt bad for having such thoughts, I wanted them to disappear, but they didn't, not then, not now. A week later I realised that talking to her made me feel better and less anxious, but a day later they announced to me that they were dating, I told them in all honesty that I was happy for them, they are so similar and cute together, it had to happen, but I also told them I was jealous...why? I dont know if it is because I myself am single, of if I really have/had a crush on Ben or that I knew I would spend less time with Alex from know on. I tried to hide my bad feelings and started to mask them, always staying happy and understanding, i think rather successfully. But the last three days were tough.....they started to hang out without me more often, something completely normal and things that couples should do as much as they want........is what I am saying and should be feeling honestly.....but I feel alone.....I don't have many friends, I struggle with asking others to hang out, Ben and Alex are the ones I spent 90% of my time with and its hard for me to see them be happy without me..... All my thoughts are all over the place, I wish for them to be happy, I love them both so much....but on the other hand I wish they never met, or leave me behind. They don't realise that I struggel...but thats because I dont want to tell them, I shouldn't be their stepping stone, I shouldn't be like broken glass laying around them.....my feelings shouldn't matter when they want to be alone or if they ignore me because they are freshly in love and only have eyes for each other...I understand, I was there too.....but it hurts.... I cry for the third day, not knowing what to do, I dont want to burden them, I don't want to hurt them, but I feel lost, lonely and worthless. Am I a bad person? Am I a shitty friend? I dont wanna be the special snowflake that needs special care because she can't keep her feelings in place....my depression keeps getting the better of me and my anxiety takes over....I feel like disappearing forever....but for what reason? This is no reason to make me feel like dying, it's a stupid reason and I want to cast these feelings aside, but it seems impossible..............help",1

Listen I get that people don't want to talk directly to me just about me. It must be because I have selective mutism and present as really mentally slow. it really stresses me when that happens.

"Handling my family I’m a fifteen yr old male and my older brother (20yr) was recently diagnosed with autism, he is high functioning but has a lot of social issues. I’ve had to rearrange my entire life to cater to his needs now and it’s difficult and for some reason whenever we argue like all siblings do or I argue with my mom they always make me out to be the villain in every situation. Here’s an example, we’ve recently decided to rewatch the entire MCI timeline of movies because we enjoy them, almost every five minutes my brother will point out very minuscule details, at first I had no problem with it but when we got to the iron man movies it went from five minutes to every ten seconds constantly “ohhh that’s that iron man suit number, or is it the other one?ohhhh let me check” and is constantly talking all the other small details that don’t really matter at the moment cause we’re just trying to watch a movie and he’s just rambling so I pause the movie and ask him to stop he says and ok and then just keeps going. This happens around to more times before I snap telling him to just be quiet and watch the movie and then my mother stepped in. Here’s context, earlier when we were watching a different MCU movie my mother was very confused about the plot/story so I said “hey mom can you put down your phone for this scene it explains everything” she nods and watches the rest of the movie joyfully and laughing, now let’s get back to when she stepped in between me and my brother later. She agrees that he needs to settle down but then I’m immediately bombarded with her trying to make me the villain and then asks “what’s so important that you’re looking at you’re phone during the movie?” In a sarcastic And I replied “just looking at my phone, why are you mad at me about it, you did it earlier” and then she snapped now defending my brother, in previous arguments she tends to be very minuscule with details and I always have a retort because most of the time she’s just angry and doesn’t know what she’s talking about and then flips the fact that I rebutted into me being the bad guy in every situation, it gets worse because she’s a hypocrite about it. When I get annoyed and snappy and go down to the same amount of detail that she uses when she argues she gets mad at me, except when she’s the one doing the nit picking and using the small details in her mind it is somehow justified and I shouldn’t be annoyed at her. It seems like a mental trap that I’m always the villain in these situations. Any advice on how to handle this stress? I need it. Edit now that I have left the room because my mother didn’t feel like continuing the movie because I somehow ruined it, she said she was going to sleep. That was a lie because she is now joyfully chatting with my brother, I almost feel like my family is happier without me. Maybe I’m the problem.",1

It's gotten to the point that I became sick. I currently feel the effects of depression now, my own family hasn't always treated me the best but I miss my home.",1
"My aunt and uncle said they would take me in and let me live with them. This is honestly the best news I've received in such a long time Like I'm legit crying right now and can barely type. I posted a few hours ago about my dad passing away a year ago and how my life has felt so empty and cold without him. It still does to this day. I miss just being in his arms and miss every little thing about him. You have no idea. And when he passed, my aunt and uncle were actually taking some time apart from each other because of marital issues. They still came to the funeral and even stayed with me in my apartment for a week after. They've always been loving and affectionate and all that even though they were on the other side of the country. At the time, they did offer me the chance to come live with them but I declined because I still had to finish college. He never got to the chance to see me in my cap and gown... Anyway, after I made my posts, I quickly called my aunt first and asked her if I could come stay with them. Eventually my uncle came in and we talked for about a half hour until my uncle asked, in a genuinely curious tone, ""Why do you want to come now though?"". And I just told them the truth I'm scared. I don't like being alone like this and not even having a friend nearby for support. It's just me. But thankfully they reassured me and said they'd love for me to come, even offering to pay for a plane ticket. I cried myself hysterical after they hung up. And it's also extremely timely since my lease on my apartment is up in the end of July and I haven't renewed yet. I'm just a mix of genuinely happy but also still sad that he's gone. I'm not even sure what to do with his ashes since he didn't specify where I should take them or anything like that. But I'm at least more hopeful.",0

"How long does it last? It frightens me to know that depression can follow you into the future, it frightens me to know that this feeling can make you feel the ugliest of things that you wouldn’t wish on anyone else…it frightens me to have these involuntary thoughts invade and take hold of me for unknown lengths of times, gripping around me like a corset. It worsens when there are triggers… It’s worsened over time, and whenever I feel like I’m getting better it just comes back and washes all of my productivity, my discipline, my determination, my happiness all away. I’m tired of having to mask for periods of time during social interactions, during work, during a small moment like going to the kitchen and having to say hello to someone that’s in there. I’m becoming increasingly exhausted, I have those thoughts that we never want to have. I’m constantly wanting to just erase the pain, I constantly feel like a bother to people who ask if I’m alright… I swear I’m not seeking attention I swear I’m not lazy I just wanna be happy.. I don’t even know why I’m here if I’m just meant to experience this horrible, vicious cycle…",1
"Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself. Today, I am in an even worse position than I was. I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues. I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago. My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home. I wouldn't be crying every single day. I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function. My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down. There would be none of this suffering. I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it. I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever. Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally. ( Sorry, just in my feelings today. I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't. There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine. Maybe I don't think positively enough.

"Struggling to be honest about my symptoms to my psychiatrist in med management appointments. Hi friends. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for like two or three months now. I really like this psychiatrist, but I struggle to be honest about my depression and anxiety symptoms with them at my med management appointments. I have been telling them that I’m feeling better, but I’m not. I’m actually worse. But when they ask about ~sensitive things relating to thoughts and behaviors~ I deny experiencing them or participating in them, which is a lie. I don’t know why I’m so scared to say anything, but Im so nervous for this next appointment coming up in about a week. They are very receptive and kind and they seem to genuinely care, so I don’t think this issue has anything to do with our doctor patient relationship. I’m also nervous that if I say something at this next appointment, they will think I’m lying since I haven’t admitted to it in the past with them. Thoughts? Advice?",1

"Meeting a fellow suicidal student in middle school changed my outlook on life. You really never know what's going on with someone. This is a reminder to just be kind when you can because you don't know what's happening under the surface. I was reading a post that reminded me of a certain conversation I had with a fellow student back in 7th grade. I was in a lab group with three other kids and this guy who was insanely smart and always cracking jokes rolls up his sleeves. He's got all these scars on them and so another girl in the group asks about them. He just casually tells us he has a cutting problem. His parents had to confiscate knives and things. The rest of the group kind of just was like, ""OK wow that's scary"" and then we just did the assignment. I feel like I missed an opportunity there to help someone out. This guy just opened up about something so personal, and I sort of just was shocked and confused so I didn't comfort him and I didn't say anything touching or kind back. Honestly, I think I just couldn't process it. Was he joking? For me at least, lots of people joked about depression and suicide all the time in middle school. It had never occurred to me that some of these people actually felt that way. When I think back on the whole interaction, I realize I would never have known the internal struggle this guy had even existed if I didn't just happen to be in his lab group and he just happened to roll up his sleeves. I'm also really bothered by the fact that no one was concerned in the group, including myself. Another thing that severely bothers me is the fact that this was middle school. I feel like that's so crazy young and the reality that kids were already facing so much pressure and stress forces me to seriously question what the heck is going on in society right now. The main thing that this has taught me is that you seriously never know what someone is going through. I would never have guessed that this kid hated themselves like that. He was so smart (I kind of was jealous at times) and he made the wittiest jokes 24/7 and he was always smiling. I don't know what has happened to him. I think he switched schools the next year or moved or something. Wherever he is, I hope he's doing well and I hope he's found some real support since our school didn't provide it.",1
"Life story alert I've never really considered myself suicidal but i have had thoughts before. I have undiagnosed ocd and invasive thoughts. So I've always assumed the suicidal thoughts were invasive. In which they probably are because i have no compulsions or motivation to follow through. I guess i mainly find comfort in the fact it is an option. In a way it makes me feel like i am in control. I'm 28 with absolutely no friends. I am married with 2 kids and they are the reason I am alive today. I am still lonely as hell. I always thought I was going to have the typical ""boys"" like In sitcoms. Poker night, football watch parties, always popping up unannounced etc... all my ""friends"" are either dead, in prison or addicted to drugs. Reason for the """" is because I have abandoned anyone that puts me or my family at risk. Kind of makes me feel guilty but my kids and wife come first. I struggle to find my purpose. I'm obese and that paired with my mental health issues makes it hard for me to work a normal job. I run a small demolition company to make ends meet. It puts me in control of my situation and my schedule. The downfall is it has made me more anti social then ever. I have a problem meeting/trusting new people because to be honest most of my past friends and people that I've met have been total losers. I didn't have the greatest childhood. It wasn't terrible either though. My mom has always been a lost soul in a way. Blamed my dad for making her move to Wisconsin from California. Was always going to the bar/bringing home random dudes. So my sister pretty much raised me. Moved in with my dad when I was 12. He worked 12 hour days 6 days a week so never really spent time with him beyond weekend movie nights. Always kind of felt like a burden and treated like a chore. Instead of truly being pushed to become my best self. Worst part is I find myself treating my daughter like a burden because of my mental health (makes me easily annoyed and very impatient) I wish I had some damn patience. Anyway so after I moved in with my dad I started falling into the wrong crowd and eventually got sent back to my moms when I was 15. Well long story in the middle of a long story short she called a social worker and sent me to a group home. Was I being a shit stain? Yea I was selling weed but who just abandons their child over that? Anyway after going through the group homes my dad took me back. After 3 months back with my dad I met my wife at 17. Everything was good for 3 years besides the fact my wife's parents dispised me and did everything In their power to tear us a part. Hindsight 2020 I can't blame them because I was encouraging her to sneak out/stay the night with me against their rules. Then at 20 I had my daughter. Its one of the best days of my life. I love my daughter to death but ever since then I've had added pressure and this sense of being restricted that I never felt before. Added note I was homeless from 13 to 23 besides the short stints I lived with my mom, dad or was in the group home. From 20-23 I just couldn't get my shit together. Job after job. Followed by irresponsible choice after irresponsible choice. Finally at 23 after couch hopping all those years me and my wife got our first place(that we kept more then 3 months). Life started turning around and then I had my first panic attack. Talk about getting torn a new asshole. As I do with everything though I pushed through and weathered the storm. Fast forward 3 years and I welcomed my son into the world. Another best moment ever followed by added pressure and more restriction. This was shortly after I started my business and stuff started picking up. For the first time in my life I started having hope. Actual fucking hope. This continued for a year and a half. At this time the rental we were at had a pipe burst and basically ruined the ceiling. My landlord being the p.o.s he is took months to fix it and when he did we had to be out of the house for a week. This was our breaking point when it came to him and the rental market in the area. We decided to relocate 3 hours away. That was 6 months ago. This is when everything seemed to fall apart. I've always been the person that finds the best in everything and maintains a positive mindset even when the house is burning down. That flew out the fucking window about 5 months ago. I've gained more weight, my business isn't surviving the move, unemployed, no friends, I feel trapped and the pressure puts an insta-pot to shame. I have eleminated every responsibility possible because I'm scared I will fail. It is hard for me to get out of bed because I feel like my life has no purpose. I truly don't think I would ever kill myself. Like I stated im fairly certain its just my invasive thoughts acting up. I'm strongly against medications. It is not that I think they don't work. I am honestly scared of the side affects and feel like I am mentally strong enough to deal with the problems without them. Also I don't trust therapy because I don't believe there are enough subcategories for mental illness. I don't want to get be misunderstood or diagnosed with something I don't have due to someone who basis their expertise on knowledge obtained 15-20 years ago. (Feel like technology has had a detrimental affect on mental health) I don't know what I am wanting out of this post. Support? Criticism? Advice? I am not really sure. Maybe I am hoping someone might read this and find strength knowing its ok to not be ok sometimes. Maybe I'm reaching out hoping someone might have gone through this and can help me. Regardless I don't plan on going anywhere. I know that no matter how hard shit gets. No matter how much you think people don't care about you. Killing yourself will destroy peoples lives that you care about. Suffer for them so they don't suffer because of you. Thank you. Love you.",1

I don’t want to put too much details on what that falling out was, but basically I destroyed his trust in me and not only that I lost literally every friend I had. Me and him where so close together that when shit hit the fan, the other people in our circle stopped talking to me. It took me 2 years to recoup my social loss and all the depression I had. I had tried to commit suicide but failed after saying goodbye to my friends over the phone. They called the police and they came out to speak with me. During this time I also started to delete all my social media. I deleted my twitter account, instagram, and partially my Facebook. I took down all my photos of my face and Unfriended all my close friends (except family because My only means of communication are thru Facebook) Finally during that summer I started feeling like myself again. As if, things could turn for the better instead of the worse. I chose to go back to school to try and put myself back on a good track in life. When I was in school before the events above, I was planning on joining the US Army as a Second Lieutenant. It’s been a dream and passion of mine since I was born. My parents have pictures of me all over the house in army costumes and huge cardboard boxes that I drew on to look like tanks. I felt alive being in that uniform. Especially in college as I joined the university’s ROTC program. Unfortunately as I grew older, my parents health became poorer and poorer. My father has crushed discs in his spine as well as diabetes and early onset dementia. It’s mostly he will forget directions to the store and what he did yesterday or 3 hours ago. But apparently he will soon forget our names. My mom has MS and fibromyalgia on top of PTSD from some trauma she experienced thru her childhood. As well as had extensive surgeries in the past. Both take extremely potent pain killers. My dad is the worst with it. He literally snorts them like coke and does atleast 5-7 a day. My mom has to control how much he takes but there pain is so severe most days there’s no other remedy I can really show them. I tried talking them into medical weed but my parents aren’t interested in the properties and say they won’t work. From there medical history you can tell they don’t have any income except for my oldest brother who is a high functioning autistic adult currently on his Masters Program at the same school I was attending. So financial issues has always been a problem for our family. We don’t have any other family with us. Both my moms side and my dads side hate us for some reason so it’s really just me that they depend on. I have another older brother, but he moved out and hasn’t spoken to any of us in awhile. He calls during the holidays but that’s really the only contact we have. My parents are always...ALWAYS behind the ball on bills and we have had multiple disconnections from the electric company. One time, they didn’t pay for 3 months straight and the bill totaled 866$ on top of reconnection fees. So I had to figure out how to pay all of it because my parents had no earthly idea how to come up with the money. Every month for the past 3 years has been a challenge for money. I’ve worked jobs, stolen things, sold drugs just to keep us up but it’s just never enough. 2 years ago they had a house they where buying and had went behind on the mortgage for almost 6 months. I had no idea because they never told me about it. They lost the house and had to move into a rental. And who took care of that? I did. I’ve been having to care for my sick parents since I graduated high school. I had to put my dreams aside because I couldn’t just leave for the military. They couldn’t even last the couple of months I would be gone for training. So I put my dreams away to try and hustle and work to bring them out. I started looking into ways of making as much money as I possibly can but EVERYTIME I make a breakthrough, something happens like my car breaking down. Or something doesn’t get covered by insurance. And since I stole, it had come back to haunt me which of course I expected. Thankfully I never had to go to court or anything so I’m having to pay a restitution which is too much a month for me to pay and yes I have been missing those payments. I understand the repercussions of those actions but I have to focus my energy on maintaining my apartment which I rent ontop of my parents house which I help pay a portion for as well as the electric and internet. As well as dog food for the dogs, the gas for me and my dads car. A portion of my oldest brothers books, as well as other things here and there to keep them afloat and alive. I am drowning in debt. I went back to school to try and get a business degree this semester. But the age old need for assistance from me came back to haunt me and instead of investing my financial aid from college on some business ideas I had to try and make it ended up going to there bills and mine. When I realized I spent all my grant and scholarship money on bills and not my textbooks and school stuff I just withdrew. No point in going to class unprepared. Also since it’s the fall we have had no business for landscaping so we’ve been short on jobs. I’ve been trying to apply for seasonal work and other jobs but so far it’s been more of a bust than anything good. Now I’m 1 week late on rent for my apartment. I have to come up with close to 1000$ in less than 3 days to pay my rent, my bills and my parents rent and bills. So I’m basically beyond fucked. I could kill myself, but it’s not gonna solve the problem. I just don’t know what to do. And tbh I just wish I can be someone else right now. Like delete this saved game and start new lol. That’s my rant for the day. I don’t expect anyone to respond to this so if you read this and commented. Thanks for listening.",1
"Can stress make you pale, tired, and cause weight loss? I've been going through a rather stressful period for the past 6 months, and since then I've lost weight - at one point I was struggling to eat, was feeling sick every time I ate - I'm feeling and looking tired all of the time, and I've become very pale. I'm pale anyway, I'm fair skinned, but I've been described as being translucent of late. I am eating more now, but I'm not really putting any weight on. I'm slim naturally, so right now I'm just looking like skin and bones. I seem to be more susceptible to illness as well. I keep catching colds, and I had a bout of food poisoning, all within the same month. My bowel habits are off, too. I'm going as normal, but it's always soft. I'm going the doctors next week, but a little worried in case these aren't symptoms of stress, and it's something else.",1
"I started a new job today and I can honestly say things are looking up ) I started a new job today. Im in Michigan and the place Im working is a marijuana cultivation facility. The pay is good, the benefits are good, and I get paid to play with bud all day. Moreso, I am so proud of myself for starting to get help and work through my issues. I started some meds to help with my depression and because of that things have been getting so much better. I am actively trying to do better with my life, be healthier, eat healthier. Getting a new job is one of those things that made me open my eyes. I was working in a dead end place before. You can't go anywhere with McDonalds. You can move up into a management position but that's more than likely the only place you will go. At my new job, it's such a growing industry (heh heh) that the opportunities to grow as a person are tremendous and I can't wait to learn everything there is to know. Anyway, I don't have many people I can tell, so I thought I would tell you guys. Thank you for letting me share my excitement. For once in my life, I am actually able to say I am a happy person. It's been so long for me to get to that point and I'm incredibly grateful for where I am now. There is still so much hard work to do on my end, but things are getting better.",1

"Does anyone else feel CONSTANTLY stressed? My whole life I’ve always felt stressed. Say I’m super stressed about getting an assignment done the night before and I *do* get it done, I never feel relaxed. The same “stressed” feeling stays. I always feel like there’s something I could be doing with my time. Does anyone else feel like this?",1
I'm a worthless person I have no hope and I think I don't have a meaning of living. Feels like all other people hate me and against me. Just want to jump off the window and end my life.,1
"Stress hives? So I’ve been breaking out in hives for like 2 weeks now, thought they were big bites at first because I haven’t changed anything to make my skin break out... then they spread and spread, all over my back and hands. I took Benadryl for a couple days and slept for the 16 hours a day I wasn’t at work. I don’t understand why I’m breaking out? I don’t even feel that stressed, really... I mean I have stressful stuff going on (healthcare worker, death in the family, and SO deploying) but I’m not *feeling* particularly stressed about those? I guess my body is more stressed than my brain? Or my brain has been so stressed it’s numb from it now? I don’t know what to do, I can’t sleep for 16/24 hours. I don’t understand. Has anyone else experienced this? I work out, I drink a gallon of water a day, I eat healthier than I have my entire life...",1
"I finally told someone I want to die. They replied with, “We’re all sad, but we’re alive, and that means something.” Fuck you. I’m not just fucking sad. You don’t want to fucking die when you’re just sad. I am fucking suffering. This isn’t fucking living. This is fucking prison.",1
"Do you ever want to quit everything I just want to quit everything. To do nothing for some time, to feel relaxed. I dont remember how this feels.",1
"Chronic stress/anxiety and the aftermath of its related issues. So long story short, on the outside I have the seemingly “perfect” life 31yo female with no remarkable health issues, a thriving career making a decent living, a happy and healthy young daughter, in a long term relationship with a man who loves me (my daughters father) a beautiful home, nice car, no real financial troubles (aside from overspending/undersaving).... however, I have been dealing with major, chronic stress/anxiety for about a year now stemming mostly from my relationship (75% stepchildren related) and now my job (because I am unable to resolve this stress). I have always had anxiety issues, so I have been an evening marijuana user for approx. 8 years to wind down and help me sleep. This stress has recently turned into depression ~9 months ago when my stepdaughter was alienated from us, “because of me”. It was then I started to notice new, troubling acute and intermittent symptoms, like brain fog, poor concentration, NO libido, inability to relay thoughts consistently and effectively, extreme fatigue, no appetite, no strength, high BP/racing heart, weakness, to name a few. 4 days ago, I experienced what I believed to be a mini stroke - although I was “alert”, I felt very disoriented, couldn’t talk normally, felt confused, off balance, numbness in hands, felt like I was gliding rather than walking. After a couple of hours, I eventually went to urgent care to get my symptoms reviewed, as I simply just did not want to commit myself to ED if it was not 100% necessary (I know that wasn’t the best option in that moment, however I felt for me it was.) Neuro exam review was “fine” they said, and she said I likely had an inner ear infection, and gave me Antivert and said to follow up with PCP. Me knowing my history, I was not sold on that diagnosis, but felt fine enough to accept it. Today I followed up with my PCP whom I’ve been with for 10 years. She agreed that it likely wasnt an inner ear infection due to lack of symptoms, so I have an MRI ordered and will be going tomorrow. I actually work in the medical field, specifically mental health and addiction, so I am very well aware that my stress/anxiety/depression/MJ use are likely the reason for my issues. I am concerned about the damage my body has endured with this stroke-like incident. Has this stress simply turned my otherwise healthy body over for good? I know without a doubt all of these issues have put me where I am today. A few weeks ago (prior to the “stroke” incident), I was certain I had MS due to all my progressive symptoms, yet knowing deep down the real, most likely culprits that would need to cease before going to major diagnosis like that, but the only missing symptom was a stroke- then bam! That happens. I have not used MJ for 4 days (I’m fine without it), but the relationship and kid stress is something that will not stop or go away. Basically I’ve decided to finally move out to get away from the stress I cannot control, and I’m hoping that will save my life. Work related stress I used to handle like a champ, but now I’m falling behind at work and unable to catch up. If things keep going this way, I will eventually lose my job; or worse, my life as this constant fight or flight is slowly killing me. My mood is just emotionless. At this point, I’m simply in survival mode which has essentially ruined/ended my relationship. I realize I must make some major lifestyle changes, I am just hoping to hear that these issues are resolvable assuming I make the right decisions. I also am well aware that chronic MJ use plays the biggest part in my mental health conditions, however I had used that to cope with them, up until now when I physically just cannot do that anymore. Anyone have anything to say? Not even sure what I’m looking for here, other than someone who has experienced this and understands what I’m going through.",1
"Just a Sea of Darkness I try so hard to see the positive things. I try to focus on the sunlight and flowers or yummy food. But lately? The sunlight just burns, the flowers are wilting, and nothing tastes good. Everything is cardboard to a depressed soul. I stopped my medication for several reasons so I knew it would come back hard. But on top of that, I've had to live in a greasy motel for a month with my husband, daughter, and two cats. Then move into our house which has cost us thousands. Then get ready to send my 2 year old to daycare for the first time while I go back to school. Right after finding out my husband is deploying for a year. I'm used to being a single mom at this point. He's always gone. But he's prioritizing his coworkers over his family right before he leaves. And he knows my depression is horrible. But he's only unkind to me. Angry. Unsympathetic. What hurts the most is that last night, someone struggling with depression called him and he talked to them for hours to help them through it. But me? Me he shoves to the wayside with little concern. He brushes me off as selfish, overdramatic, and more. I don't have anyone to call. I don't have anyone to talk me through it. Nobody cares enough, no matter how much I struggle. So I struggle through it silently and alone. And every day I wonder if it will be the day I finally break. I've endured so much pain. Sadness. Loss. Trauma. Abuse. I don't know why I've kept going. But lately, every day seems meaningless. I'm just numb, going through the motions of being a responsible and level-headed adult. All the while I'm spinning out internally and I have nobody to turn to. Loneliness is my only friend.",1
Going to ask my girlfriend of one year to marry me on her spooky October birthday. I never in my life thought id find a woman so understanding and so sweet and caring and doesnt judge me only wants to see me happy and i hope she feels that from me. I love waking up to my best friend she makes me so warm and loved when i come home from work. My dog absolutely loves her. I have nightmares shes not in my life and i want to fix that. The last couple months we have been calling eachother husband and wife. I hope she likes the ring and says yes. I just want her to be happy. Thats all i want. Even if it means we arent married. Love all of you.,0
i wish i could restart my life become someone else and actually do something good with this life.. but its impossible. my only chance to be something is gone.,1
"Overworked over stressed overwhelmed So I just have these random moments of anxiety and fast heartbeat at times. I think the majority of the time it’s my job that causes me to feel stressed. I try to always keep in mind that I can only do so much but having this mindset doesn’t always keep me from feeling this way. It’s pretty stressful job and now having been there a few months I can see why people come and go. Also living with a toxic parent hearing him call my siblings horrible names and constantly arguing with my mother for the dumbest reasons. It’s all too much and I just really wanna find a way out. Just writing this is causing me to be emotional. I just want to be stress free. There’s just no way that this is life, I refuse to believe it ....",1
"Lifes just bland just venting(ignore) i came to this reddit to post about whats been on my mind. But looking at other peoples posts it really puts into perspective how dumb my issues are when people are going through actual life changing shit. Somehow it makes me feel worse since i still feel like shit and I know i shouldnt and i should just deal with it. My issue is that I just feel like I dont have any real friends, and whats worse is that I know its my own fault and mine alone. I have probably 10-15 “friends” at school, and I know they all snap eachother and have their groupchats and hang out with eachother, but when i was younger I was really busy with soccer and i never really “got in” to that. Now it just feels like its too late for me. I feel like no one would even talk to me unless i talked to them first, no one would notice I was missing for a day or a week at school, and they certainly wouldnt care. I feel like my only value to them is that Im good in school(have answers and hw etc) and im good at soccer (when school soccer comes around). I used to have a best friend who i hung out with often, im really not sure what happened but we arent best friends anymore i do not think. Even the small things make me feel left out, driving to events together, sitting in cars hanging out before school, and then stuff like hanging out. Just makes me feel unwanted. No one ever invites me, asks me where i am, what im up to, im just an afterthought, maybe ill get remember maybe not, doesnt matter to them apparently. And its only made worse because I agree with them, and I understand. I dont bring anything to the friend group, im not real funny, or nice, or anything out of the norm that isnt school or soccer. Ive been telling myself for a while i just have to get to college(currently a junior in hs) and ill have a chance to start again, be more social, talk to more people. But i realize now that is a lie, its not just a switch i can flip, i cant just choose to be how all of my friends are, i just never learned how(my own fault). im not depressed i dont think, thats reserved for people with actual problems not stupid friend quarrels, but life doesnt feel very good either, i dont look forward to school anymore, i dont want to see my friends only to feel even more left out when they talk abt their plans together later that day as I stand next to them. Im only happy when im playing video games or on the soccer field. in between that, lifes just cold, grey, and mediocre. If thats life then im truly not sure that I want it, why should i keep living with so little to look forward to, especially when i cant even man up and be more social on my own. I sat in a parking lot today thinking abt why I would want to live. And i couldnt think of much that was for myself, I guess ill just keep living cuz im too scared to really do it and for my family. My life is just a melancholy thing, my one childhood is blown, ill never have what they had, and thats just an incredibly depressing idea for me. Also, fuck you.",1
"Why am I still stressed out about schoolwork even though school is out for the summer? I just went through a prolonged period of stress due to AP exams, interviewing for/working a new job, final projects, SATs, getting behind in schoolwork, getting worse end-of-year grades than usual, and grieving over my pet hedgehog dying (I really loved him and it was really awful when he died). I am not a ""crier"" in any way usually. Up until about a week ago, I couldn't remember the last time I cried. Now, even though that period of stress has passed and it's now summer break, I feel like I could cry at any moment if I wanted to. I can understand that, of course, because I'm still recovering from all that emotional overload, but what I can't understand is why I still feel stressed about SCHOOLWORK specifically. Every time I try and think about planning what I'm going to do this summer, I start to get the same anxiety I feel with schoolwork deadlines, studying for tests, or anything else school related. Even though I try to tell myself that I have no schoolwork left, my brain somehow just doesn't believe me?? I feel like I can't do anything fun this summer because I'm so busy with schoolwork even though I literally have no schoolwork to do at all. Why is this happening and how do I move on so that I can actually enjoy my summer break?

"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it. I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*. If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation. It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different. More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore? Edit Thank you for all the comments.

"Burnout/Computer Issues HELP! Hi reddit, i'm in need of some advice. 2 Years ago i worked myself into a burn-out of which I am still recovering. I worked in an online marketing team that had a lot of desk/computer hours. I still don't have a lot of energy and i still feel stressed, emotionally drained from time to time and still have a hard time living a normal life. However, my biggest problem is that I cannot do computer work anymore. Whether it's gaming, watching video's, school work or just browsing for fun, i cannot last longer than 45 Minutes without having one or more of these following symptoms - Lightheadedness - Heavy head - Pshyical Stress, my body feels pumped up like it want's to run a marathon - Concentration Issues I do not seem to have these symptoms when staring at my Phone Screen or TV screen. I've always spent a lot of time behind my computer (Gaming, Chatting with friends etc) but now i cannot even have 1/8th the screen time that I could endure. It kinda feels like my brain associates just sitting behind a computer with enourmous amounts of stress. My question is, is there a way I can train my body or mind that I do not feel stressed anymore when sitting behind a computer? I know that I'm not fully recovered yet and that I cannot expect big results but It's a big part of my life that I don't want to lose. I already correct my shoulders when they are tense, I take regular breaks and I don't do work that stresses me out. Even gaming (which is one of my favourite things) I cannot seem to do anymore.... some advice would be appreciated! TL DR There is nothing that stressed me out more than sitting behind a computer screen, tips?",1

My partner has unsteady income which stresses me out on his behalf. I have a steady job, don’t make a fortune but it’s safe and have career prospects.

"Just deleted a suicide note I wrote two years ago. I don't recognise the person in it, it's not me anymore ) I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through. I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been.

"i can’t keep doing this 16 F) i’ve never knew how stressed out i was with everything. two days ago i had a mental breakdown at work. i remember hanging clothes on the sales floor and having suicidal thoughts. i remember not being able to breathe, so i quickly ran to the restroom and broke down in tears. i started banging on the sink out of frustration and anger. I haven’t been diagnosed yet, but if the doctor told me i had depression, anxiety, and bipolar depression. i don’t think i would be surprised. my manager came in the restroom and asked me what was wrong but i couldn’t get it out. this is my a millionth time crying at work. just last week i congratulated myself for not calling out sick when i was really just depressed. i told her she should leave and not to worry about what’s wrong with me because i’m use to constantly crying. i then leave the restroom and ran to my car without clocking out. my crying became even louder and i started banging on the steering wheel while screaming. i just don’t know what to do anymore. ever since that day i’ve been thinking about going to do things such as getting my nose pierced, but lord knows how my african parents would take that.(at a point when i don’t even care anymore and do what makes me happy. they already weren’t happy when i first got my hair locked up.) when i came home later that day my mom asked me why was i crying at work. of course i couldn’t tell her because african parents never take this type of shit serious, so i shrugged it off. (my school called my mom back in january about my suicide attempt, and she was pissed off about it. she told me not to tell them that next time.) it’s been so many fucked up shit to happen to me within just one time frame this year, but i mean everyone had a bad year this year.",1
"Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have",1

I think it's the supervisor's job to know if I'm drowning or not. She was on vacation last week, but I have to admit that I can't keep up. She already had to reassign some of my work once. This is adding more stress to everything. I started looking for a new job, but I'm really nervous and stressed about going in on Monday. I may need to quit this one before I find a new one.

"Do you always find yourself ruminating on the same event every depressive episode? For context I’m a 33f, married for 6 years and with my husband for the last 15 years (minus a year on-and-off period). During that on-and-off time, I was very depressed and my now husband broke up with me in a very shitty way and did a few things that hurt me badly. I decided to get back together with him anyways because I couldn’t imagine not being with him. He’s a good person, he’s never given me any reason to think he’d do any of those things again, I trust him etc. etc. BUT every time I go into a depressive period (which is every 2-3 years), I ruminate on that time. I become super critical of our marriage and him, when before the depression I’d say we’re happy. I think because it was my first major depression, my brain wires itself to go there. I’m in therapy to talk about it now. I’m wondering if anyone else revisits the same trauma when they’re depressed?",1

I'm not **fishing** for compliments ever...that said though * First time I ever wore my new Doc Martens (and first time I'd ever worn boots anyway, so I was sorta nervous) a nurse, that I'd never met, complimented me on them during a doctors visit and said I look great in them. * First time I'd gotten a super close fade, shaved on the sides really low and was nervous about it, a random girl who'd never seen me without that haircut said she liked my hair and it looked good. * First time I ever wore glasses after getting them, total stranger older dude said he liked my glasses and it had reminded him of someone he used to work with. * Just recently wore a tank top for the first time, a guy in line said he was jealous of me because he used to wear tank tops but couldn't since he grew beer gut, said it's a good look. * And today I wore some new shoes I bought that weren't my usual style, some like...loafer boat shoes? And a pair of red chino shorts...Definitely not my usual style but it's too hot out so I needed new clothes. Got complimented TODAY about my outfit!!!! Point is is that I don't get compliments **ever**...….unless it's my first time wearing/doing something or looking a certain way that makes me a little nervous.

"Somebody noticed I am not ok Went to a doctor today because I suffered an injury while drunk. The doctor (God bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if I was Ok. Actually pretty much told me I'm not Ok mentally. Asked what happened to me, how do I feel, why do I drink. Gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist. It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description. I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears. Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs.

"Holy fucking shit I can’t stop beating myself up over past mistakes I think of a name, a face, a place, a year—the only things I can recollect are negative.

"My problem I have no faith in myself I have been the same since high school. I work really really hard for everything, because I am convinced that I won't be able to achieve anything if I put a normal amount of effort in. Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and ""being focused"". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly. I dread going to work and I am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either. My bf visited me this past week and I couldn't be happy he was there (even though I hadn't seen him in two months) because of the stress I had in my head.

"Mental check in with a stranger. Weird? Hi This is my very first post on Reddit. I’m 35, transplanted to San Francisco to work in tech two years, and I miss my family very much since they all live really far away from the States. I know it was my choice, and I should no complain about it. However, living in a new country, learning a new language, and adapting myself to a new culture have been challenging. I realized my mood has been constantly shifting more often than before. I could be totally okay but irrationally emotional when I experience something that remind me certain past feelings. I realized I need help. But how? I am alone here without genuine friends close by. I don’t think talking to my old friends or colleagues could help cus it puts me in a vulnerable position where I’d feel uncomfortable. I don’t think I need to seek for a pro therapy yet but I definitely need to feel cared, heard and supported. I started to wonder if there’re million of people like me who feel lonely and helpless lightly from time to time. Recently, I got connected with a person over the internet. We didn’t know much about each other but we just started this short check-in everyday somehow. I felt there is a hope and need to keep going cus I want to report my daily life briefly to this person. Sometime my day is bad and sometime isn’t. I don’t feel shame if I say I procrastinate today to this person.

"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*? I'll start by saying this Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly. It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together. Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that. I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me. Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much.

"I have lost my empathy. Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone. It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing.

"My Ongoing Journey with Stress and How to Cope I find stress to be like most things in life good in moderation. I have found myself in many stressful situations at work that have forced me to focus on what's important and to get it done. With too little stress I find I have no motivation to move forward. Too much stress (or the wrong kind of stress) can be debilitating and possibly detrimental to your health. There have been many times where I have stressed myself out over what ifs that I end up saying fuck it or I end up in a ball on the floor sick to my stomach (whether it's going out by myself to see a friend's band, talking to a girl, or reaching out to others when I need help) and my mom has stressed herself out to the point where she's had panic attacks in the past. It wasn't until the past few months that I've come to understand stress (or at least come to an understanding that helps me). For me stress boils down to a conflict between the way things are and the way I want them to be. For example, right now I am trying to launch a side business, maintain my 9-5, help my wife with our 9 month old son, and train for several up coming endurance events. I want things to go smoothly and find time for everything but life has other plans. A couple of months ago my team was working on a big release for our product and I had a pivotal role. There were some nights where there was never a break. I would put in a quick workout after work, cook dinner for my family, try to make some progress with my side business, and after my son went to bed I had to do some work for my 9-5. I felt overwhelmed. I felt guilty that I wasn't doing more. And most of all I felt like I wasn't good enough. I wasn't a good enough employee, I wasn't a good enough entrepreneur, I wasn't a good enough husband, and I wasn't a good enough father. There was one night where I skipped dinner and just cried in bed....I had two options. 1) Let the stress get the better of me and drop some of the things I am trying to do or 2) figure out a way to cope. For me the first step in coping was mindful meditation, where I learned that I am NOT my thought and I am NOT my emotions. I learned to quiet my mind and focus. I learned how to separate myself from emotions. (I'm not saying that emotions are bad. I still feel everything but I don't allow them to control me or send me into a tail spin anymore). My second step was realizing that the mental, physical, and emotional selves are interconnected and can go into a feedback loop. Example I had a call recently about my side business that I was nervous about. As the time for the call drew closer I got more nervous. Then I started to think ""Who do you think you are to even try doing this"" which fed into my nervousness to the point where I felt queazy. If I had allowed it to keep going I probably would've made myself sick. I stopped myself when I realized what was happening used some exercises I learned in my meditations. Once I was able to calm emotions I focused my mind to preparing for the call giving it no room to explore what ifs. It wasn't until later that I realized that once I was calm and focused my stomach settled as well. My third step was to learn how to start gaining control of my mind, body, and emotions. One of the techniques I use regularly is nasal breathing. Did you know that breathing though your nose and into your stomach engages the parasympathetic nervous system. (The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system is more related to restoration and digestion) So what does that mean? When you engage the parasympethic nervous system you short circuit the sympathetic nervous system effectively halting the fight or flight response. As an added bonus focusing on your breath takes your mind off of the situation for the moment helping to calm down and focus once you return your attention to the situation at hand. I still have times where I get stressed and depressed but I know have steps to cope with it. Sometimes it's a matter of lightening my load and other times it's changing my focus from what if to something tangible to move myself forward. I know how debilitating stress can be and I hope my experiences/ongoing journey can help.",1

"Did you ever end a relationship in peek depression and did regret it later on? My former bf broke up with me a few days ago. He was struggling for 2 months now and in the beginning he was still staying with me, reaching out. He kept saying he wants to be with me. We had arguments, tough fights. But we stayed together, both doing our best. I granted him space, he tried to still reach out. Two weeks ago all went worse. Something happened and he said he just wants to be alone, he doesn’t want to care for anybody and he is deeply sorry but that’s how it is. He even refuses to talk to his family, shuts them out an me. Says his safe place are his gaming friends. I am not the person he can talk to anymore. It was very important to him to let me know none of this is my fault and I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s all on him. He just isn’t at the place to be there for me or help me. He needs someone to talk to. Things have happened and things have changed. The guy I knew is gone and won’t come back. He had to go so he can get better and stronger (?). I still don’t know what that means. He rather wants me to move on and find someone who can give me the world than being friends with me. He can’t talk to me anyway. He blocked me on Snapchat where he usually sends snaps to friends and where we had some serious conversations the last days after break up (he reached out, not me) but kept me on all other messengers and platforms. He said he thinks we won’t work out. He says he doesn’t know what will happen. He is also suicidal and has ADHD. He said he doesn’t want anybody or anyone, he only wants to be alone. And all his feelings are gone. Whenever I ask him how he feels about me, he doesn’t know. He never said anything about not loving me anymore. I am deeply hurt and heartbroken, I thought we could handle it. I did research for months and was there for him, didn’t leave when it got tough. But sometimes love is not enough.

I feel like I waist my time if I'm not being productive in some way and that if I'm just chilling it's a waste of time so I end up turning hobbies like reading or excercise into work. It poisens relaxation time. Does anyone else have this, how did they deal with it?",1
"Anyone cry at the sight of normal families? It started when I was quite young. I remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father. I remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up.

"Stress during specific classes I’m taking online classes just lake a majority of the population right now and I have 7 classes I am taking, we do A and B scheduling but one specific class stresses me out so much. And I’m really confused as to why this is happening it’s not like the class assignments are a lot we get a fair amount of work but not a lot. But every time I’m in that class or go to do the work for that class my heart beats so fast to the point where I feel like it’s going to come out of my chest and my breathing gets all heavy and I get a stomach and head ache and it takes a bit for me to calm down. I have not been diagnosed with any sort of anxiety nor am I going to self diagnose. But it has really become a burden because it takes me half an hour or so to calm myself down, on top of that the class requires cameras to be on and don’t mind it but I will literally be in so much panic and I have to pretend I’m fine on camera because of obvious reasons. I just got out of said class while typing this out and im still on edge and my hands are shaking i just hope this can stop soon because this is a class I can’t get out of doing until next school year..If anyone has any tips or advise I would greatly appreciate it.",1
"Addicted to depression I don't know am I the only one with this, but every time things start going better, it never feels right. I feel like I don't deserve being okay. The sadness has become like an addiction. It feels weirdly good? I don't really know, but whenever I'm the lowest it feels the most comforting. I think I've already gave up on trying to heal.

"I'm sick of being so lonely I never liked social interactions much throughout my high school years even after high school, I avoided people, I avoided all kinds of social interactions, I had very low self esteem and I enjoyed just playing games and staying at home. As years passed, I realized I put myself in a very bad place and I am literally craving some human interaction like for fuck sake I LITERALLY have no friends from my own city, I HAVE NO ONE TO GO OUT WITH, I have a friend who fucking calls me when he needs something fuck that. I have a camera that I bought and I barely took any pictures because I don't have a person to even practice portraits on, I'm so fucking lonely it's crazy and no matter how hard I try, I'm never lucky to build any type of social life, I just want to be normal, I just need one person, that's it...to go out with me, make me feel normal, talk, it's just one person why can't I have that? I don't know what to do anymore, I'm 24 and time is passing, how many more years am I gonna waste? How can I go on trips alone? What the fuck do you do when you go on a trip alone? It's fucking awkward, everyone else is with someone and you're alone. I literally don't go out anymore, I feel disgusting, I feel inferior, I'm always alone I become embarrassed, I dress fucking well, my hygiene is not bad, I'm very nice to people so what the fuck is the problem here, I am NEVER negative IRL, I try my best to be cheerful even if I am in a bad mood.

"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ? Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it. I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking). But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored. I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void. When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life. Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything. Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy. Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now that it's over ! (I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice) I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore. Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text. Because I feel like it's useless and boring. Is that just depression in a way ?",1

"Just fed up with my awful career choice I’ve recently just decided that I hate my career choice of music. I just never excelled in it in any way and here I am with a masters degree and I’m just sitting around hopeless with no where to be or go or do in my career. Like I knew from the beginning that you don’t go into music for money but go into it for passion but it doesn’t even fulfill and sense of passion that I thought I once had. I did my undergrad in piano and played fine enough but not good enough to pursue any sort of anything on piano and finished my masters degree in composition just hating every piece of music I’ve written. I feel like I came out on the other end of this degree just more aware that I’m not a competent musician. I have zero desire to pick up an instrument and truthfully I’ve been thinking about donating them to my undergrad university becuase they’re just gathering dust here. I don’t enjoy practicing and I can only play a few pieces worth hearing. And out of all the music I’ve written, I don’t think I’m proud of any of it.

"I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”. Update Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules. Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease & desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has gone on this year too. It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again! TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",1

"Being in a relationship is a rollercoaster, but in the end it's so worth it As with anything in life there are both peaks and lows (just ask Bitcoin xD). But I'd like to hop on here to talk about the most important person in my life ^D. My Girlfriend and I , it's so weird calling her my girlfriend because she is basically my best friend ^D, has changed my life so much and seeing her grow everyday constantly inspires me to do the same. She's made me realize that I have a side of me that doesn't have to be this super macho tough dude , it's okay to have a down moment , it's okay to talk about things , it's okay to not be okay blue_heart white_heart . Finding that special someone who can be that ear that always listens has brought me so much happiness. I'm not saying its always dandelions (maybe not dandelions, she's big boi allergic to them xD) and roses for our relationship all the time , but talking about the quarrels we experience ultimately strengthen the bond between us , even if said quarrels are super hard to talk about . Bottling it up inside isn't the way to go , trust me I learned that the hard way; always strive for happiness. If I had one word to describe my best friend, it would be happiness . She's done more for me in close to a year than most of my long time friends have , it's just a testament of her outstanding character ^D. I want to keep doing everything in my power to keep my best friend happy . Her smile , her eyes , her nose , the way she smells , her amazing sense of humor , ability to understand someone else's perspective, artistic aptitude, and her intelligence are all just a few reasons why she is the perfect one for me <3. I tell her how amazing she is all the time , but I felt like I wanted to get it out in the void that is reddit. I don't know if she will ever see this and or acknowledge this , but if you are , I love you so much my awesome blossom blue_heart white_heart . PS . Apologies for the grammar mistakes and idiom overload , it's kinda my thing xD PS PS. I don't have anything else, I just thought it would be cool to have another PS hehe TL;DR She's definitely the ""one""",0

"Finals and college applications are feeling like too much. I'm fully aware that every student encounters stress around the time of finals, but I'm completely overwhelmed. Honestly, I feel cheated as well. All my other friends in public school are skating by in all their classes, talking about how they never have homework, how their finals are so easy, etc. They go out, live it up on the weekends, and spend time with friends. Senior year is supposed to be my time to have fun - the last chance to be a kid before going off to college. I'm stuck at an insanely rigorous private school that assigns me hours upon hours of homework every night and even more over the weekend. Finals are cumulative, meaning students are responsible for every detail of everything we have learned this year. I could understand the reasoning for giving cumulative finals if broad concepts were being tested. However, it's not just broad concepts. It's every date and every battle about which we have learned in history. It's every problem we have done in math, and the same for every other subject. It is all an unbelievable amount of material being required, and I do not truly feel like I can manage it. To make matters worse, I am currently right on the line between letter grades. Doing well on my finals will pull me up, and doing poorly will keep me down. I would not normally be so stressed about finals, but they are a kind of ""make it or break it"" thing at this point, especially because certain colleges require my first semester transcript. I just finished applying to the honors program at the college I will most likely be attending, but I have been so swamped with work all the rest of my life that I'm not even sure I even want to embark on something else challenging. I hear college is the place you make all your true friends, ""find yourself,"" and everything else like that. I just fail to even comprehend this idea because all school has ever posed is stress. It feels like all my LIFE has ever posed is stress. Anyone who survived a rigorous and stressful high school experience, please tell me I'm going to make it. I expect the best of myself and hate myself when I can't deliver. I lose my head when I get too stressed, and I don't even feel like I know what I'm doing anymore.",1
Starting to think think therapy is a waste So I’m 23 years old and I’ve been in therapy since I was like 10. I have generalized anxiety and I have a bear phobia vomit where every time I stomach hurts I get a sensation I am a scary panic attack thinking I’m going to just get sick. But the point of this post is this therapy actually work? All the years I’ve been it has never worked for me. Even trying to listen and do the techniques it doesn’t work. I just saw seen a new therapist and I only saw her once and I already don’t wanna go back because all of them say the same thing and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Is there any websites to help or books ?,1

"My parents are leaving for vacation. They asked me if I wanted to come with them (they are leaving for 9 days) and I said no cause I had an old guinea pig I was taking care of. I noticed my piggy was eating less so I wanted to stay home to check on her daily. Well, just yesterday I came home from work and she was dead. I'm pretty sure it was do to old age cause she looked pretty peaceful, maybe she was asleep when she passed. It really sucks and I am not already in a good state mentally right now, infact I've been pretty bad the last two months, so I took a big hit to that. So now tonight, my parents leave in a few days and I'm going to be home alone for while.

"Can stress utterly cripple my health and is there a way to fix that? Shot in the dark here and if this is the wrong subreddit let me know. I slept 2 hours tonight cause my anxiety is ruining me right now. Trying to keep it short, so here goes I've been sick on and off since November. It's majorly sinus infections that just won't go away. I believe that my allergies cause some inflammation episode, but I'm starting to wonder if the stress does it too. November is thanksgiving. I'm allergic to furry animals (not in the way where I could drop dead, I mostly get headaches, itchy and stuffy nose) and I have to visit my family for holidays. Problem is, they have several pets (cats and dogs) that aren't necessarily well-groomed. Their fur is matted and greasy and if I pet them (cause I'm stupid and can't help myself, also animals soothe me in moments of stress) the gunk gets stuck on my hands and it sticks to anything I touch (I drank bottled water and hours later when I took a sip from the same bottle I could smell it). Family stresses me out, they're too toxic to me, but I feel obligated to go. Last year I had an anxiety attack prior to Christmas because of how badly I don't wanna go and I had just recovered from my first episode of sinus infections (despite taking allegra TWICE prior). So Christmas came, yet another stressful event and back to sinus infections after. Then I got REALLY sick (couldn't move for an entire day because EVERYTHING was sore, I couldn't even talk cause those muscles hurt) but finally recovered. A few days of stuffy nose (which is an improvement, mind you) and I wake up feeling like my face was punched. Eventually figure out it's my sinuses and it wasn't my husband accidentally sucker-punching me in the middle of the night. First one side hurts, then both. Nose gets stuffy. Can't touch or move my nose in any way because of the pain. It took a while but it went away recently. Yes, recently. It's February, and I've essentially been sick non-stop since Thanksgiving. Now the kicker is that today is a family member's birthday and I plan on calling her (too far for a visit) but I couldn't sleep from anxiety. Other family also invited themselves over for my birthday and I get snarky remarks when I tell them I'm busy (which I truly am, and they should know this...). I won't be meeting them YET, but I will eventually or else I won't get to hear the end of it. I felt off yesterday (I barely had a few days of feeling normal-ish which still means a stuffy nose) but today I just feel flat out sick, like I'm gonna develop a cold. Throat feels coated, I keep sniffling, sinuses feel swollen and I'm nauseous. Just last year I thought I could pride myself with a decent immune system because the last time I remembered getting sick was for a few weeks (thanksgiving and xmas again, duh. It didn't last months like it does this time), now it's like there's a queue of health problems that my body checks off one after another so everyone gets their turn... What would you guys recommend for me to do? How can I manage this stress or at least avoid getting sick? My stress levels are pretty bearable but being sick for so long is taking a toll on me and it's starting to kick me into some serious depression. I feel the life draining out of me and with family knocking on my door in the near future my mind is just going in circles about how to even survive all this, though part of me doesn't even want to anymore. It sucks!!! ( Is my immune system suddenly retarded? Is it ""just"" my allergies that caused almost 4 months of inflammation/sickness now or could it be that it's all the stress doing it? I do get more and more stressed about holidays with every year... I didn't have anxiety attacks until last christmas, before that it was ""just"" crying and needing my husband to calm me down somehow with lots of effort. I'm at a loss and I'm even more stressed today between not having slept over this birthday call and feeling sick AGAIN.",1
"Jealous of other peoples lives I’m so depressed that it’s gotten to the point where I can’t even be on my phone. I saw one of my old friends post a picture of her college life and just started crying. I even get jealous seeing my own boyfriend out with his friends. I’ve never known what it feels like to not be alone and to have people actually wanting you around. People say it gets better yet most of my life has been spent just staring at my four walls in my room. I feel like I’m wasting my early 20’s but I can’t help but isolate cause I’m in pain. Yet I have to motivate myself to continue to eat (cause I have an ed) and act like I’m fine so I don’t worry anyone. I’m just so tired and this empty feeling hasn’t gone away. I just want to be normal and go to college parties, have tons of friends, and experience things that other people my age do but my fucked up brain prevents it. I’m my own worst enemy.

I want to go back to the ward I just got out of the ward after a 4 day inpatient stay. And honestly… I miss it a lot already. This place I went to was really great and the staff was super nice for the most part. I had some bad experiences with two of the patients but I got through it. I really don’t like the outside world much at all. There is too much pain here. At least in there I can at least try to help people a little bit.

"So stressed I feel like I’m drowning I’m in my mid twenties (F,25) and living with mother. Lately all she does is say negative things about me and it really puts me down. I feel like I do everything wrong. In my work life, my love life, social life, everything. I was dating someone new and we recently broke up. It was so abrupt and the circumstances suck, and now we aren’t talking after getting into an argument. It’s hard to not let it get to me. I keep thinking what if I had been more supportive? What should I have done to fulfill their needs while grieving...they say they won’t date anyone else but what if they’re lying .. thoughts keep racing and making my heart beat fast I’m still unsure what I’m going to do career wise and if I can afford to live alone and if I won’t feel anxious living alone... All my thoughts at once make me feel really stressed out and it’s keeping me up at night. I don’t sleep until 6 am sometimes disappointed_face ",1
"Advice/ rant Hi. I’m a 20 year eng lit major. I feel so lost, depressed and directionless. I don’t even know what I like, what I want to do in future in terms of my career. Everything seems to give me boundless anxiety (for examples the uni clubs I’m part of). All the responsibilities are weighing me down. In addition to GAD, depression and social anxiety, I also have body image issues. Literally almost every sphere of my life seems kinda joyless to me and I can’t even picture myself living my life till I’m 80. I honestly feel like giving up (although I’m not gonna do it). I’m trying to turn my life around and stop being lazy and procrastinate over stuff. I’m trying to go out for walks and hydrate and journal but the future of my career and depression is weighing me down. Any tips would be appreciated! Have a great day!",1
"I can't say anything good about me Sorry if my grammar is off, i'm not native and not in the mood for looking words or checking if it's right) For context I started to go to therapy for around a month and a week now, it has been helpful but i feel like i always undo all my progress, sometimes i feel good with myself for a few days but it feels like my lows are getting lower? idk if that makes sense at all. Last week my therapist told me to say something positive about me, and i tried to focus on it, and realized that i can't, anything that i can think of i discard it as a lie, and the therapist insisted in me saying something, i sat there in silence for a few minutes and almost cried, then just gave up and told her that i couldn't. Because of that she asked me to came back next week with at least one positive thing about me. One week has passed and i'm here, writing about being unable to do it, the session is in one hour and i'm panicking, i don't want to fail but i don't want to lie to myself and neither to her. Have you experienced this in some way? How did you overcame it? Really anything would be helpful. Maybe this post doesn't even makes sense, this is my first post ever so... sorry i guess. I just wanted to vent about it, and see if someone knows something that could help me with that, ty.",1

However, when I think about how mysterious this world is and how I won’t ever find an answer to what this all is it and makes everything and why, then even beautiful places and interesting people just seem blah. Even thinking about things that are accepted as just a part of life like sound and taste and colors even become disturbingly confusing and unexplainable. It’s like yea this is nice but if this is all random then is it really even that wonderful or grandiose as we make it. Idk but I wish I could get past these thoughts and just live and enjoy.

"Can stress/anxiety cause a low-grade fever? Here’s the story Since September of 2019 my stress/anxiety levels have been off the scale. I was in a car/motorcycle accident with my family & boyfriend. We were all in the truck and physically fine. However there were two people riding the motorcycle that rear ended us. One passed on scene and the other has very very slowly recovered after many surgeries. I dropped down to part time in school, took leave from my serving job and quit my second job during the fall semester and had gone back full time for spring. Id been blessed to had never seen any kind of accident like we did that night. Now, 7 months later I find myself stressing over my normal things. Money, health, family, bills, school, the sound of a motorcycle, however it’s on a totally different scale. I started taking my temp when I feel myself get that shaky, stomach turning stress/anxiety. I’m finding that my temp ends up at 99.6-99.9 when I usually sit at 97.8. I know that doesn’t sound like much but I’m wondering why this is. I plan to soon get professional help after our current pandemic settles. Thank you in advance for advice and explanations!",1

"Severe stress, I literally feel crippled, cannot stop throwing up I am a 34 year old female. I have had quite a year to say the least, amidst all the other nonsense going on (covid, riots). I am also in the middle, hopefully near the end, of a messy divorce with an extremely resentful ex (no kids, thankfully). Due to me moving out on my own, I started to have some financial issues, then it just seemed to snowball. I got into a fender bender in my brand new car, have to pay a $500 deductible, and unfortunately still pay my car payment (I was honestly hoping it would have been totaled and got me out from underneath the loan). Then I started to get a sinus infection and they made me test for COVID (which was negative, but I had to take a week off work anyway). I just can't seem to get it together and I literally feel like I'm killing myself with all this stress and nonsense. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin all the time. I get very disoriented and ""dumb"", feel like I'm in a dream, debilitating anxiety, muscle twitches (specifically my right eye), shaking, exhaustion, can't get my thoughts straight ever (I seriously cannot remember if something actually happened lately, or if I dreamed it) ,and lately, just throwing up constantly. Going to work is a nightmare (I'm an insurance broker - and have been for 4 years), but I've missed a lot of work this year and all of my co-workers pretty much hate me. The thought of sitting chained to my desk all day makes me crazy, but I know I need to go because I need money. It's a non-stop shit show. The only thing that seems to help is alcohol, which ***trust me*** I know, does NOT help. I can't live like this anymore. I know there's a happy, fun girl in there, but I'm so lost. Currently, I'm on 100mg of Zoloft which seems to be doing nothing. I was taking Mirtazapine briefly, which is great for sleep, but not so great if you're trying to watch your figure.

"Been struggling with becoming healthy and my fiancee told me she was proud of me So, I've lost weight before but sacrificed alot of my health to do so. This time around I decided I was going to do it te right way, which is the slow and difficult way. Instead of crash dieting for the quickest results, I count every calorie that goes into my body, bapance my micronutrients, lift weights 3 times a week, and train in martial arts 4-6 times a week. I love what I am doing but some days can be particularly grueling. This Tuesday, I came home after sparring and got really beat up. I was very sore and bruised up, so I was sitting silently at my desk chair kind of sulking. My fiancee came over to me and told me she was proud of me, out of the blue. She told the fact that I've been going every night and working this hard amazed her.. She said it has nothing to do with the weightloss, just the fact that I don't quit is what makes her proud. I took a day off to heal up a bit, and now I have a whole new reserve of motivation knowing that I'm making my family proud, because that's all I've ever wanted. I'm not married and don't have kids yet but I will soon. I know this is something I need to do for my future family, and it already seems to be paying dividends.",0

"Isn’t it weird to explain that you’d rather feel sadness than nothing at all ? It’s so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many , I used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like . I think when I feel “ better “ , it’s not really like happiness , it’s more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness / normality . I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there’s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable .

"Anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others? In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence.

"I have no motivation or will to live About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal? I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education. I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive? My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless.

"Just want to vent about my stress. I moved to a new city for school. No friends. No family. My best friend just moved out of state. University starts in 13 days, I have to study truly immensely to make up for taking last semester off to be able to move here. My dad told me (after years of pressure of importance of college) not to go to school and just do whatever because I was only offered loans. We can barely afford this. I have to get all A's to raise my GPA to get into a better/tougher school that has a free financial aid coverage plan for those who can't afford it ASAP. I work, but need to also get a work study job at University to help with tuition. The rent is expensive out here. More money, more time, but less time studying. I live in this beautiful city, but I have no money. I want to try so many restaurants, I feel so passionate about food lately, it's not about being hungry. I need clothes. I need textbooks. My school parking pass is 150$. My dad wants me to be working a serious professional job within a year, I just turned 21. My family has always had money troubles, my dad was a single parent and worked very hard to take care of me. My mom was young and things were complicated. I just want to make a lot of money and become a professional and take them on vacation. We've never had a vacation before. I'm so stressed, for so long.

"I got extra credit on my science project Probably nobody cares but I’m just sooo insanely proud of myself and I really want to talk about it. We had to do a project on energy sources and I did a bunch of research on wind turbines and made a google slide and everything. It was pretty interesting because I actually learned how they worked. I was really nervous when I was presenting because I didn’t know what they would think of my presentation because I thought it wasn’t as good as the other ones. But when I went to present, it’s like my mind went blank and some weird part of my brain took over, I started making jokes, explaining in detail, making up my own sentences without even using my slide project. I opened my presentation with “prepare to get blown away” (because it was on wind turbines) and everyone laughed. And then I went through every slide I had and explained it all way better than I thought I would. I did stumble over a few words but it wasn’t that bad. here’s the best part When I finished, it was all silent for a second and then my science teacher said, “Ashlyn.... that was AWESOME.” And then everyone was clapping. I was the last person to present and the teacher didn’t react that way even for the people who I thought had the best presentations. I’m glad I was wearing a mask because nobody could see how teary I was getting and how much I was grinning. Then, when I looked up my grade, I saw he gave me 10% extra credit.

She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance.

My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life.

My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel.

"Do you experience depression"" question at the doctor's office I went to the doctor for an annual checkup recently and one of the first questions the nurse asked in the initial screening in the exam room was something like ""Do you experience depression?"" I wanted to answer honestly because I do a lot of the time after some of the turns my life has taken, so I said ""Yes."" Then the nurse looked at me and prompted me to take my answer back and change it to ""No"" by telling me that if I say ""Yes"" that means like suicidal and I guess would be something they'd have to report. The fact is, I do think about suicide. I mean I've never acted on it, but it's not like the thoughts don't cross my mind. I just don't understand how we draw this firm, clear line between ""normal"" people and ""depressed"" people, and then if you outwardly manage your depression well enough, they look at you like you're crazy for saying you are depressed. Even worse is that some caring, well-meaning person probably had the question added to the triage process in the first place, but then in actual practice the person asking the questions pushes you to not answer the question honestly. What is the point of even asking the question if you are just going to push people that experience depression and manage it the best they can to lie and say they don't? I think my depression likely does have actual negative consequences for my overall health too that might be relevant to the medical exam. Thoughts?",1
"Stress is bizarre This is the first time in my life I’ve had to deal with real stress. I’m 17, and am leaving for a 5 month volunteer program in two days. I have to fly across the country on my own, where I’ll meet the group of strangers who I’ll be spending the next five months with. This on its own is very, very stressful. I have social anxiety, and I’ll have to leave my family (the longest I’ve been away from my parents is a week). But because I’m leaving in early January, this meant finishing all my classes early. I barely studied over the winter break. I did two tests today, which I think I did okay on. But I have all my exams tomorrow, plus another test. I’m screwed. I’ve been trying to cram all the information I can into my brain, but I feel too fatigued and strained for any of it to even make sense. And I just discovered a new unit of material in the study guide my teacher gave me, which I didn’t even know existed until now. And that’ll be a big chunk of the EXAM tomorrow. I’m bound to end up with a very poor grade, which is in biology, the path I want to pursue in university. How the hell can I imagine getting into university if I can’t even do okay in the high school class? I only identified the issue I’ve been struggling with as being stress a couple days ago. I said before then “ugh I’m stressed out” and whatever, but I didn’t know what that really meant until now. It took a while for me to link the racing mind, insomnia, gastrointestinal troubles, racing heartbeat, restlessness, diffuse concentration, low cognitive performance, disorganization, forgetfulness, and low immune system as all stemming from the same issue until then.

I’m on autopilot and I’m not even panicking the way i always do/should be. I am confused and i don’t know how to word it correctly, hope i make sense",1
The peace of sleep Lately I’ve realized that the only way to get peace from my depression and the world is sleep. The problem is when I wake up everything hits me hard. Does anyone else feel like this?,1
"It sucks how my bullies are living their best lives (having sex, traveling and having fun) why I'm suffering lonely at home crying everyday all day.

"Already screwed up at new job and I feel terrible I just started a new job, haven’t even been there a week yet, and I already screwed up. I work in an office, never worked in one before, so I’m still new, but I feel like my job is already in jeopardy. I was let off with a warning, but now I can’t make another mistake. It’s only been three days. I can’t disclose what happened for confidentiality reasons, but needless to say I feel really stressed out right now, and I don’t know what to do.",1
"Am i even alive anymore? This year has been very tough on me. From getting covid and barely getting over it, to my abusive family coming back in my life, to me almost falling into drug abuse again and my gender dysphoria just kicking into a brand new high gear as i question what the fuck i even am anymore. I thought taking a trip outside of it all would help, it just made it all more obvious that i was stuck in that cycle and that there is no escape even if i leave the country the bad shit follows me everywhere. I now have survived a suicide attempt but i dont think ill be able to stop myself another time. Especially since this time im going to be alone in my home from now on. What do i do",1
"Bored and lonely My life is as grey as it can get. Everyday is painfully boring, nothing makes me happy anymore. Existing itself is bothersome and not worth the effort.

Everyone left.",1
"Physical reactions to stress So I'm dealing with a lot of stress right now from a new job, and I've noticed my body behaving differently after I started working. I've been coughing a lot lately, I feel like I can't breath, some discomfort in my stomach from time to time. I don't know if this is normal? I was perfectly fine before the job, but should I go see a doctor?",1
"I'm stressed about work I've been with my company since i started working at 18. Its all i know and recently its becoming more and more apparent that i cannot handle either the level of work I'm putting on myself or the level of work that is imposed on me. I don't know anything else other than what I've been doing here and i don't know where to start should i leave. Sometimes I think that it's all in my head and I can push harder to improve. It feels like I'm against a wall that i can only just put my finger tips on top of. I wish i could stop it all and breath, but i can't. The situation I have prevents me from not doing anything. I need to be working to live the way i am. I'm scared and I'm not, I'm worried and im not. I live in some kind of emotional purgatory where i can't feel more than a hint of happiness or sadness some days and others i feel normal. i want to live in a better state than I'm currently living. I'm not happy but i don't let myself feel sad.",1
"Rescued A Dog To Add To My Family He Is A Sweetie!! So I noticed this dog was always chained up to a tree with no food or water barely any shade. You can tell this dog was not happy and abused the owners did not treat him well he is very under weight he is about roughly one year- two years old. Yesterday I get home and I see he somehow got loose and he was running around freely. I decided to take advantage and rescuing this poor dog and bringing him home. I will be taking him to the vet soon to get checked for any parasites, HW/FEC tests, shots etc. When I brought him home he was so happy to see a big backyard plenty of room to run and do dog stuff. He was starving when I gave him some food. He is very sweet and loves to jump up and say hi to everyone. Plan on teaching him the basic manners etc. Wanted to share this.

"I'm only 0,5 kg left to my dream weight and I feel so elated beaming face with smiling eyes  For the last two years, I've struggled so much with my weight, and I've hated the way I look to the point of not wanting to go out, because I was afraid people would stare. My bf at that time (now ex) would always point out that I've gained weight, everytime we'd meet. Also people in my surroundings, even my family kept saying ""maybe you should consider losing weight. You can see how much that affected my self esteem... I think I wasn't that much overweight, I weighted around 85 kg (187 lbs) - june last year. I'm not sure how I've started my journey. But I guess meeting the right people pushed me in the right direction. One day, I woke up, installed couple of apps, decided to try them. They were a bit hard and kinda boring but I wasn't going to give up. I stumbled across a channel which I feel in love with it instantly. The channel's videos showed a handful of workouts that anyone can follow, and most importantly I'm having fun while losing weight. So I kept going, day after day, month after month. And here I am today, super happy, because I actually managed to lose 20 kg (44 lbs) in just one year. That was my goal, which I'm super close to achieve it. I could not believe my eyes when I weighted myself this evening. 65,5 kg (144 lbs) is there in front of my eyes. All that hard work did pay off in the end. There were many setbacks, I fell down multiple time. But here I am, happy, and I'm in love with my body more than ever. I would like to thank the people who loved my body from the very start to this day now. That kind of encouragement is what I needed to keep going. Thank you so much for reading my story, I just had to tell someone, how I happy I feel right red_heart And I'm hoping that I can inspire someone, that if I can do it, so can you. I believe in you !

"I need my life to change but it never will. I wish I could change things and make things better not so much for myself because I dont really deserve good things, but really for my wife. My wife is the only thing that keeps me going and even then I dont deserve her. Ive been a terrible husband to her. I had an affair with a coworker at my last job just six months into our marriage. It took me so long to get her to even speak to me again and talk about what happend and if there was ever a chance on us trying again. I dont know why but she gave me a chance and Ive busted my ass to fix my marriage and we just celebrated our 4th year together this past july. We barely survive paycheck to paycheck and ive never been able to give her a honeymoon or anything she really deserves but she says that doesnt matter and she loves me. I wish I could give her at least a vacation at least so she can get out of town and relax a bit. She works so hard and deserves so much more than what I can give her and it kills me. We have to live in a shitty house with no heat thats falling apart, no car because ours is dead and there's no fixing it so she has to get bitched at everyday so she can borrow her mothers car so she can go to work. I dont know what to do and god....im sorry I know I sound like a whiny fuck but I dont know what else to do.",1

"My stepmom and stepbrother finally moved in with me and my dad today. We’re officially a complete family now Sorry if I don’t sound overly excited in the title lol. It’s a lot to take in and it’s been a long day and especially a long week. To get you all up to speed (or feel free to read my previous posts from the beginning) my dad has raised me pretty much all on his own from the beginning since my mom died giving birth to me. He is basically the center of my world and who I love more than anything. Sure, I have my boyfriend whom I also love to bits, and he also makes me feel appreciated and cherished, but me and my dad is something else, and I don’t know how I got so lucky to have him in my life. That all being said though, he started seeing a woman two years ago. They went to high school and graduated together and reconnected through friends. She’s honestly made him happier than I’ve ever seen him. A different kind of happy if that makes sense. But she (my stepmom) has been through a lot also. Her then husband walked out on her and their son at some point and left her a single mom. He would occasionally get in contact with her but, as she described him, “he’s the kind who just takes and takes and never gives”. She never said he abused them, just that he wasn’t a very good person. But the biggest thing that’s made me at least respect and like her is how she treats me. From literally the first day she came to our house for dinner, she saw me as her own. She saw me and just said “Hi sweetheart” and hugged me, looking at me with the biggest smile on her face. It was an odd feeling because I just never really felt any sort of motherly love like this before. But fast forward to now and they have both finally moved in with me and my dad as of today. The past two weeks have mostly been spent moving stuff over to our place little by little. Me and my dad went over to her place to get what was left. I’d only been to her house a few times before and always liked it even though it was rather small; one floor actually. It was weird seeing it so empty and barren, and it was especially hard for her to leave it all behind. She stood at the front door for almost two minutes before finally having the strength to close it for good. And even then, the hard part wasn’t over. She said goodbye to all her neighbors who were waiting for her and even my stepbrother had to say bye to his friends. That honestly got to me a little bit, seeing all of them crying. But somehow, we got through it and went home, my stepmom holding my hand the whole way there. And that’s about all I feel like sharing for now. Though some of you are probably wondering if I love her, my stepmom. And honestly? I do. I respect and care about her deeply like everyone else in my life and am beyond happy to have her. So happy that now I can’t imagine being without her. I really mean that. But I don’t know if I’m ready to call her mom yet. I had one and I know I love her even though I never met her. It’s complicated, and I’m sorry if I make it sound that way. But hey, I’m happy and everyone’s happy and that’s what’s important. TECHNICALLY she’s not my stepmom yet since they haven’t gotten married, but you get the idea. My dad has also already framed a photo of him and her that they took in the living room, where he’s hugging her from behind and they each have the biggest smiles on their faces. It’s beautiful. I know my stepbrother is kind of iffy about the whole situation also but already likes my dad, and I think the two of them are going to become quite close. If I think of any more details to add in, I’ll try and edit this when I get the chance. Thanks for reading!",0
"Despite all downfalls and against everything, I couldn't be happier with how things are going. Happy with myself and how lucky I am to date the man of my dreams ) Super new to reddit, but in all honesty I read this reddit as often as I do my religious studies and after seeing everyone share their joy never fails to make me smile. So I want to share mine as well -) btw, I'm not a native English. So if sentences don't make sense, you now know why I have known my now boyfriend ever since we were in middle school. He met me during one of the hardest times of my life as a kid. I found out I'm incurably ill at a very young age. Not something that will be fatal on long term but quality of life is severely reduced. As kids his company was one I enjoyed alot, everytime. In all my years of meeting people I've never consistently been able to enjoy someone's presence. Years pass, we change. I did not for the better for a long time. Stuff got to me and I got bitter. (Which, til this day I wish I realised how down bad I was. I'm still thinking about how I could've been better) however, we remained friends but through my act I made him feel not loved with my rough attitude. One day I realised just how poorly I was doing and treating those around me because I got so bitter after alot of things happened. I realised I didn't want to be like this anymore and lost myself over the years. I distanced myself from every thing. Stopped using my phone, computer and consoles as a whole as I started to do some self reflection and learn. Alot of times passes, I wrote down his info to pick up contact again after I bettered myself before I took a trip. I promised him that when I'm ready I would soon greet him again. Going back to people I once knew was harder than ever, all I thought of was how people perceived me and how I was like before I saw in how I was. I struggled contacting him but after months of contemplating I did it. And I couldn't call him. That man singlehandedly changed his phone number dammit! So after contacting some other people who knew both of us they gave me his new info. I messaged him scared whether he would accept me or not and to my suprise, he did. I explained to him everything that went on in my mind and how I look back on myself. From that point on things improved even beyond what I thought. Being around him has made me learn even more. And eventually I felt things were getting a bit awkward. In a pinch and desperate effort I told him that I liked him alot and just needed to get it off my chest because the awkwardness that I felt. I would be fine if he didn't feel the same I knew what risk I would take because if he didn't feel the same at all, well, we all know where that can go. And he said he liked me back and that he always did ever since we were young. I don't know how to transition from this point on in my writing, but life has been so good. We can talk about things, I can be myself even if I am rather childish he always loves seeing me happy and doing what I want to do. He appreciates the transparency of our relationship and that we can talk about every little thing that bothers us and it's okay, we respect eachother and don't mock eachother we listen to each others feelings and improve from that point on. Even if he has odd passions I love them. Seeing his interest and pure joy he finds in a hobby I can't help but smile. I've had some confrontations with people who hate my guts. Rightfully so, it's okay that they're mad and I understand. It motivates me even more to better myself. I've been invested in my roots, languages and beliefs. My health has hit a downfall and I can't do much anymore, I no longer work and had to take care of myself. He's here to support me through it. The path to recovery and getting my health back together will take a long ass time, but hey, atleast I'm with a guy who told me he thought he was going to marry me when we were 10 ) The biggest lessons I've learned and I hope someone can learn from these as well. Respect and equal treatment is important. You never know what someone is going through so never snap at someone because you have your own bad day. Consistent effort and showing you care builds long term bonds, it's okay to be tired but be sure to talk about how you feel and those who really appreciate you will understand how you feel. And last but not least, perception. Do not work yourself up over something someone said if someone comes off rude, I guarantee most of the time someone just worded it poorly. And even if it was meant to hurt you teaching yourself how to perceive the world and things around you will make even such things won't affect you anymore, you'll feel more joy and your quality of life will significantly increase when you start to smile at strangers and see everything in a positive light. The moment you start doing it it becomes natural and will only become a better and more dominant trait over time. Oh and, do it for yourself. Make changes you want to change like investing in a subculture that's not 'socially desirable' but you've always admired. Investing and developing interests will make you feel more confident. I play drums but also love knitting sweaters and I'm proud of these drastically different hobbies. oh and, really the last one. Tell them that you like them. Trust me on that one Sorry I treated this like a diary entry but maybe someone enjoys reading it haha, I still suck at writing. A last reminder for those who need it, know that you're loved. Surround yourself with people who MAKE you feel loved and do not feel afraid to leave and start over again and you can finally start fresh. It helps. I'm proud of you and you should be proud of yourself as well. Little steps always count up to something bigger.",0

"I just want a hug That's all. It won't fix my Depression and it won't fix my existence. Everybody that's dear to me lives far away. I pretend to be alright to my family and parents cause i'm scared to break it to them, cause they might react with disbelief and tell me i should calm down. I did not have a real sincere hug in.... actually i don't know. I think like 7 years. I just want someone to hug me and tell me shit will be alright. I don't care if it's true or not. I'm introverted and why and would never for the sake of me engage in any physical contact like hugging with someone that gets me and that i like. I am also scared of telling ppl i do know and that know about my depression cause i think i would look weak and that they would make fun of me or whatever even tho that's very unlikely. I just want to feel like a human again, i really just want to have someone i like check in on me and not just send a meme and then be on their merry way. I just really, truly and from the bottom of my heart want a genuine hug i'm just that starved of physical contact cause i act and pretend that i don't like it while i wish for nothing else. Other people see me as this strong, independent guy doing his thing, going his own way and keeping his head up high while infact i just want to curl up cause i can't Deal with doing a Single mistake. Why do i have to be like this? I can't expect ppl do help me how i would need it if i don't tell them on the other Hand i'm scared cause i'm paranoid to be starved in the back. I feel like i will never be able to open to someone completly ever again, especially not in Person even tho that's the one and only thing i want to do. Edit I really wanna just thank you all for comenting and upvoting. I mean, i did not think for this to be successful in helping me a bit atleast. I kinda just wrote this cause i had a huge mental breakdown and didn't know what to do anymore.

Some people wrote they feel it and also want a hug i just wanna say Feel hugged atleast by me!.

ALL of you are worth something and even tho alot wrote ""this probably won't change anything"" you taking the step to write a comment? That does change something. I appreciate everyone here and you all got my respect for dealing with this shit illness but trying to look out for each other. I love all of you <3",1
"I was confident for once and it paid off I (15F) went with my mom and brother to pick up food today, our cashier was one of the coolest looking people I've ever seen. They had short black hair, that was dyed blue at the tips, so when they turned around the blue shined. They had black winged eyeliner and had multiple piercings through their ears, and dark silver necklaces. Something about them just exhibited 'cool' without them really trying. I really really wanted to tell them that I liked their hair. I've been an introvert for a long time, and my anxiety is at its peak right now, but today I went 'f it' and I told them I thought their hair was cool. They were very nice too. Even if they don't care, or forget, which they probably will and that's what I except, as long as I could do something to make their day just a -little- bit better, I would do it again.

"I'm very stressed and I know why, but what can I do about it? Please help me I'm a 21 year old man. Right now I have summer break, but I still feel as if I'm always working 24/7. I never enjoy anything in life (I'm also depressed and I have many mental issues) and I'm always tired and unmotivated about everything. And every single day feels as a heavy work day, even if I am at home having ""free"" time. There are 2 reasons of my high stress. Reason 1 is being an unhappy single and reason 2 is trying so hard to find someone, which costs alot of effort and time. Before you read this, I am NOT here for dating advice, so please dont, unless you have a magic trick that will 100% sure work for ME. Since 4 years ago when I was 17, I started developing interest in girls. Now, 21, I still never had a relationship, but even worse, I never had a date or even a female friend even though I have tried different strategies which I failed. I never hugged a girl either. I have exactly 0 experience with girls. Why am I so stressed? It is because those 4 years, first of all being single makes me unhappy. And second I have been trying very hard to find a girl, to get the first date in my life or to even make a female friend. Every single day I waste my time on ~~dating~~ i mean ENDLESS SWIPING apps. (read neverending swiping but never getting a match), asking on reddit how to get a girlfriend, asking google how to get a girlfriend, thinking about being single forever, you know what I mean. I waste alot of my time and energy in doing research about how to find a girlfriend but trust me, I have really tried going outside and trying out dating apps, I really tried stuff too. Nothing works. So how can I feel less stressed? 1. Find the love of my life and be happy, but this won't happen any time soon, it seems impossible. So what can I do to get my mind off the impossible? I really have hobbies and interests, I have a life so that's not the problem here. The only missing part in my happiness is having a girlfriend. I feel very frustrated and tired and stressed and im starting to hate life. Seeing guys getting girlfriends as if it's the easiest thing in the world just makes me angry. These days even 10 year old kids have relationships. I guess my purpose on earth is just to be a loser. I am so obsessed with dating and trying everything that I have no more focus on anything else in my life. I dont care about family anymore, I dont care about my friends anymore, I dont care about my hobbies anymore, I dont care about study anymore, I dont care about anything except I just want a girlfriend. How can I be happy without having a partner? Really, I have study, I have a great family, I have friends, I have a hobby, my life is fine. Except for being girlfriend-deprived which really bothers me alot. It seems impossible to focus on anything else than how to get a girlfriend. Is there anything I can do to feel more happy and relaxed and stop hating life? Whenever I play videogames or do whatever to relax and try to enjoy, it doesnt really make me happy because my frustration of being single and fear or being single forever, stays in the background of my thoughts no matter what i'm doing or focusing on. And whenever I try to relax or study or do anything, I feel guilty towards my dating life, thinking if i don't take action I will never find a partner What should I do to feel happy and not frustrated and stressed??? Am I asking for the impossible here? Because honestly I thikn there is no way I can be happy without a partner. I just have this desire, and it's really strong and it's growing stronger. I can't just remove my desire, can I? Edit please don't tell me to get therapy or medication. I already tried that and, just no. + therapy would also take even more of my time and energy, which I don't have this year.",1
I’ve been depressed since I was 13 and it’s all because of my parents Ever since I was a little kid my parents were always toxic and they haven’t really changed much. I was never really allowed to have friends or get too close to anyone for the purpose that “people are bad” which I understand now that people are bad but I feel like the lost sheep and I can’t even socialize and I’m 19. I’ve had depression and depersonalization and anxiety for as long as I can think of. To this day I still do and this is no way of living. I try to have a good relationship with my parents but then I remember all the past times and the feelings resurface. They would always threaten me that if I had fights at school that they would kick me out but in reality people were the ones starting things with me. I had no one to express myself to and my family only made fun of me and told me I was lying. I told them I had a condition called trichotillomania and they denied it and said that I’m lying. I would fill in my eyebrows with makeup because I wanted to hide the spots from where I pulled my hair out. In return I got made fun of and told that I look stupid instead of providing me with professional help of course when I have all these outbursts it’s because I’ve lived my life in humiliation and grief and never did someone offer to help me through the darkest period of my life. I feel like I’ve been living in hell. They have bullied me so much in my life that I can’t even function like a mentally stable person. And I can’t do anything about it because they buy me food and pay for my things so I will be seen as ungrateful and then I will be blamed again. Now I won’t say that I’ve been a perfect child either but growing up I was surrounded by bad and abusive people so I became stubborn and sometimes got into trouble but I was only young and was expected to act like I know everything which is impossible. And a good parent would be better at teaching their child but why expect your child to be perfect when your child lives around parents who fight all the damn time and hit each other But I can’t take it anymore and I can’t continue ignoring the fact that I’ve had a horrible past and it’s the reason why my mental health is so bad. I can’t even make it through the first month of college without wanting to give up because of how hard everything is. And no one even fucking listens they all just have high expectations of you. And not having self esteem or friends or confidence just makes everything worse. Should’ve just offed myself a long time ago cause there’s no recovery from this illness ever. It’s gonna be a long road of misery.,1
"Relationship stress? F/20) Hello. I’ve been in my current relationship for approximately 5 months and it’s weird. I don’t find any aspect of the relationship bad or unhealthy, except that I’m quite over invested in it and I don’t know how not to be because investing emotionally and mentally into that person is important for me. But it’s made me a very stressed out person. To the extent that it has impacted my health (periods, skin, etc.) and I’m not sure how to deal with it. Naturally, other parts of my life contribute. Things like academics and work, but those are things I have no option but to cope with. My relationship is a choice and often times, amid the stress, I wonder if it’s the right choice in this very moment in time. Any advice is appreciated.",1
"My depression was really bad last time, so some people don’t believe it might be back I had really bad depression 4 years ago, like really serious. I was 12. Now I’m 16, and I think some is coming back. I’ve started old bad habits (pulling out my hair) and have had no energy. I tried telling my mom and she just said “we all feel like that sometimes”. And she always criticizes me on things I’m still learning or can’t control (like my health). Im honestly not even sure if it *is* back, and I don’t wanna tell my mom that was she says to me is what makes me feel horrible about myself because she’ll just say “you had a tone! You weren’t being aware!” If we walk away to cool off, once I go and apologize she goes into a whole lecture that makes me feel awful. I don’t feel 16, I feel 12 again",1

"Moving Out! Excited To Get Healthy In Every Way! At the end of this month I am moving out of my Dad's house. At 26 and finally having a lifelong illness and disability manageable I am moving out of my dad's house! Yes it is just 5 minutes down the road but I am getting to start my own life! I am leaving a toxic environment! My therapist is so excited too! My eating issues are going to get better as I have control over my food. My activity is going to go up without others constantly telling me what I can't do. I won't be judged for the books and shows and food and fun things I like. I can leave and go do things without my every move being monitored and questioned. I will have privacy and space not trapped in my room all weekend every weekend to avoid my dad's girlfriend that doesn't like me. I will have a lock on my door! I know money will be tight, but with my job I will be okay. I know there will be rough times when medical issues flare up and someone won't be right there in the next room to help me. But I will be okay. The benefits outweigh the struggles drastically. I am so excited and so optimistic. I'm 26 and am finally going to be allowed to live my life on my terms.

"Extreme memory loss / pseudodementia help Hi. I need help of people who have the same experience as mine. In 2019 I was in a bar drinking beer and I suddenly started to feel an unstopping dizziness, went home and I felt I was fainting, I fell on the ground twice. Next days until now I began to feel symptoms since muscle spasms to cognitive problems. I have so many symptoms that I feel tired to write them down, but the most recurring ones are constant headache, blurred vision, pain in the eyes, photophobia, false memories, dream's memories (which I confuse with real). Weakness, fatigue, trouble speaking and writing, trouble recalling words. My memory lasts for 10 seconds and I only can remember what I payed attention very well. My attention is awful, my house can burn and if I don't look at it I wouldn't pay attention. I have super reflex and a bunch of other symptoms but my memory is so bad that I'm starting to doubt this is pure depression. The day before is a empty black for me, I don't remember anything, actually, the last 1 hour or so is already a black hole. Please help me",1
"I think my wife saved my life this morning. I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore, it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head.",1

I want to be able to talk to my family about this, but we don't talk about mental health or anything even remotely similar. At a certain point, I kind of gave up on talking to them and just decided I was going to deal with it until I graduated college and could afford to send myself to therapy.

My sugar tends to crash easily when I eat sweets by themselves. A1C comes back. Verbatim, the doctor says, ""You do NOT have diabetes."" It was 5. Normal, she said.

"My upbringing I don’t know yet if this text is self-therapeutic or I’m looking for opinions. Probably both like always. My upbringing was fine. My parents don’t fit together too well and their relationship is nowhere the definition of “healthy”. But there was no physical violence, we went to vacation and we had enough money to buy everything a family needs. With that being said, i never developed a deep emotional relationship to my parents. I never talked about emotional issues with them. Or emotions and feelings in general. Myself evolved into a egotistical and narcissistic personality as soon as i hit the age 6-8. I have no clue why.I definitely developed a fragile ego until I was 10. But things just started there. I was still one a high horse. In my class i was the first boy with a gf. (14yo). I was in love with her, but 4-5 months into the relationship i got kinda bored and ended it. I restarted it a few times because i was impressionable (the bigger and older guys in my basketball group said i did a mistake), but a few months later i was still abusing her love for me just to make out. You see, a very fragile but self-centered ego. The next 2 years i continued having “relationships” with girls. I also changed school because i was lazy as fuck. In retrospect this was the worst decisions of my life. With 16-17 i started going to parties, i got wasted a lot. I met my todays best friend. I also met this boy. He was from my old school, same year but different class. Therefore i didn’t know him yet. We we’re chatting a lot, we hit it off immediately. And very soon i realized i like boys. He gave me weird signals, we cuddled and so on. But eventually he made it clear he is not gay. The last 2 sentences outline like 6-7 months maybe more. When we we’re at friends we cuddled, we played footsie. It never happened much more, at least nothing i have to add here. As i said, eventually i told him. He said nope, unfortunately we still met and even more unfortunately. We still cuddled. I couldn’t finish this story. And this is when things heated up. I got wasted more and more, i got drugged up. I can’t specifically remember the precise timeline. After intense alcohol sessions and weed, mdma arrived as well. I did way too much mdma. Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, cocaine, medicaments, acid, ketamine. Everything. I wasn’t addicted to one specific substance back then. I was just permanently drugged up. Of course wrong friends joined my life, the good old circle appeared, which our parents have been warning us since we’ve been kids. Suppressing my emotions was the target. And i can’t say i didn’t achieve that. The rock bottom was new year’s eve. My best friend said we’re done until I’m not completely insane anymore. Since the boy i fell in love became very good friends with my best friend and we were going to parties altogether, i got extremely jealous. I tried to separate them. I got aggressive. This led to the message of my best friend on new year’s eve. Luckily i had a few brain cells left, and this was a turn point in my life. I tried to get my shit together, over the next 5 years i did less and less drugs. I wasn’t as pretty as before because i fucked up my body, so i also looked for a healthy life style. I was very insecure of my look for years. I didn’t date anyone, even though i believed i had overcome him . I didn’t care anymore when he was around. I passively began to dislike him. The last 3 years i was catching up my a level. (Since i left the school with 14 and i only did 10 years of school instead of 12-germany) In this time span my main issue was weed. I smoked for 3 months, then i was literally sober for 2-5 months. ( not even drinking coffee or a beer). I repeated that several times. I barely saw this boy the past years. 2 months ago i finished my a level. I also was sober for 10(!) months and besides school i was working 160 hours as a nurse in an elderly home(to this day). After the exam I obviously started smoking weed again. But this time not the whole day without going to work. Only after work; only one joint. Well it bored me that much, that i flushed down 50 bucks of weed. I guess weed is history. But a few weeks ago i saw him. And what can i say but “the first cut is the deepest” It’s been 7 years. And i still love him. Never believed he is not interested in boys. I think the past years when i tried becoming a better me, i actually got a few emotions back. The past two months i became more pretty again, i healed . I felt the higher testosterone floating through my body. My interest in relationships increased, tho i didn’t look for it now. When i met him, i guess i just realized i never closed this chapter. The next few days i was high af (on him and weed- i still smoked back then). Then the low point eventually appeared. And i don’t know, i feel like shit now. Depressed. I don’t care if i die tomorrow. I don’t care if i go to jail. The past years i had actual symptoms of antisocial personality disorder. (No, im not that edgy kid who thinks sociopaths are cool- id kill someone to start again in 2016 to avoid evolving into something like today) . I had intense anger breakouts. I physically hurt my mommy. I destroyed a door in my anger. I became such a good liar and manipulator, i know which buttons to press in people. I committed a few crimes, no severe ones. Ok one time i was one 700mcg acid and i had to call the ambulance. Because i low kicked the leg of a paramedic they had to call the police . I also got violent towards the police and eventually ended up in the icu, my arms and legs were fixed to the bed for safety reasons. I also lacked empathy. I had much darker thoughts too, but i won’t type em here. I’m honestly concerned. Im so depressed atm , but im also extremely motivated at the same time. I wanna finally date someone, sports every day, i read nearly 2 non fictions book per week. I wanna go to university. But im also depressed and if id die tonight id be actually okay with it. I want him. I don’t understand why it never happened. When i met him a few weeks ago; i thought he flirted with me. But i lack empathy and I’m insane. I would not even say im 30% sure. - sorry for my english. I’m german and i didn’t try too hard. - i tried to make it as short as possible , many details are missing - no clue why i post this here",1

"I feel like I ruin everything around me. Bit of a long post. But... I just got out of a really bad relationship awhile ago. I e had bad relationships since 2015/16. She basically broke me mentally, refusing to get help for her own struggles. Pushing marriage. Kids. I'm not ready for any of that. Granted if I did or dated somebody that had kids I'd help raise them and whatnot. I just think I'd make a terrible father figure. Which led to the girl I'm currently talking to. It's really hard to read her, at least to me. I'm not pushing, we both want to see where it goes. She says she has feelings and all but I really can't tell. We've gone on a couple dates, everything seemed to go well. She's honestly the bright spot I needed. But I can't read her. I try not to push or ask the same things over and over again. I'm scared to touch her. Granted I've kissed her and hugged her a couple of times, and she seemed ok with it. But I don't know if she is or not. I also feel like I bother her. Every time I ask something to her she says I'm fine. But am I? I'm not used to being told what I'm doing is fine. I don't want to do the wrong thing. She always thanks me when I help her. I've told told her I feel like I don't do enough. I feel like I'm pushing. The whole 9 yards.. the last thing I want to do is ruin something that's possibly a good thing. And I feel like I am. Yet she always says I'm fine. This all led up to a week where I would go out at night, drive to an abandoned bridge that I've been to alot, and would just stand there. Nothing suicidal. I just wanted to clear my head and try to get my bearings. There's been nights I've literally fallen asleep crying because I feel like I'm ruining everything somehow. I've broke down at work a few times. I've tried not to blow her up too much, I know she works and I know she gets tired easily. I just don't know if I'm doing the right thing or if I'm just blinding myself to whatever it is she's trying to tell me, if there's anything. Then there's the what ifs... everything I've dealt with in previous relationships, cheating, lying, stealing, using, emotional abuse...I hate them...it causes me to overthink and panic. I don't know what to do.",1
Antidepressant Withdrawls I was wondering if anyone on here has gone through antidepressant discontinuation syndrome? And if so how the hell did you cope with it?? I am light headed and faint all the time and my emotions are crazy. One minute I’m happy the next I’m crying and the next I’m screaming at someone for no reason. About a week ago I got off of Effexor (with doctor approval) and I have been on antidepressants since I was 15 (I am now 23) I feel like I don’t want to get back on them if this is what they are doing to my brain. Any tips or just experiences y’all want to share?,1
"Does depression affect your memory? Yesterday my family was talking about different vacations and memorable moments, but I almost couldn't remember a single one. Most of the things that they were talking about had happened during the worst part of my depression and there are birthdays, Christmases, parties, dates, vacations, entire school subjects that I do not remember at all. Is depression the main factor for something like this?",1
"Is there any depression advice that isn’t fucking “see a therapist” “just be happy” clown face ? Normies won’t ever fucking understand. They don’t care if you have no friends , no girlfriend, borderline insanity from loneliness, no money, no direction in life and no hope for the future. They love to virtue signal and pretend they care.",1
"Grey hair suddenly? Hi all, I know that researchers found that stress causes more/faster greying of hair but wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else had experienced this first hand as well. Almost 12 months ago now I went through an incredibly traumatising and permanently life changing experience. I have since suffered what could only be described as ongoing severe emotional stress which only now is showing the slightest signs of easing. Before the event I had no grey hair on my head. About 4 months after the event a lot of greys started growing in and this has progressively gotten worse. It is now almost twelve months later and I would say around a third of all hairs on my head are now grey! My skin and face look much older as well now, but the speed of the change on my head has shocked us all. Anyway I definitely agree with the findings linking stress to rapid greying. Has anyone else experienced something like this? And how quick did it come on?",1
"i’m the happiest i’ve ever been and it’s thanks to my boyfriend ) guys i fell in love. head over heels jumping off the diving board in love! and i think our story is pretty cool ) i (17f) started sixth form at a new school in september 2020. i have a friend (17m), let’s call him timmy, who goes to that school. for the sake of the story we’re going to call my boyfriend adam (17m). before i started at this new school, timmy warned me against this boy. he told me “there’s a boy called adam, he WILL try and get with you, don’t do it”. i’d heard of adam before as him and timmy were really close friends so it shocked me when timmy ‘warned’ me against him. he elaborated, telling me that adam had talked to many girls in the past and it had always ended badly. he told me that his relationships never last very long, and the girls he usually gets with are timmys friends, and so it ends awkwardly. so it comes to september, and i finally meet adam. he’s an absolute god. confident,attractive,funny and we quickly exchanged snapchat’s. only, i’d totally forgotten about what timmy told me. i only remembered when multiple girls who disliked adam had noticed we were flirting and told me not to be with him. i heard story upon story (some of which weren’t true) about adams past and it was as if everyone was against us ever being a thing. meanwhile, i was coming to like him more and more. on november 16 after 2 months of overnight facetime calls and afterschool mcdonald’s dates , he asked me to be his girlfriend and i said yes with no hesitation. it’s been nine months and i can honestly say that i’m so glad i didn’t let anyone come between us. everyday he makes me feel like a princess and i just feel like my life is pieces together with him in it. i know what you’re thinking. young love never lasts. but i don’t want a future without this boy. nothing makes sense without him, and i hope everyone can find this love at some point in their lives. thanks for reading )",0
"Did chronic stress kill your libido? I've had stress and bad anxiety for some time now, and my sex drive has decreased drastically.

"I went to mental hospital and got better So, I was very sceptical about mental hospitals, because in my country they have an extremely poor reputation and people who were there almost always said to me ""Don't go there"". But I did and got better. I was in a open department so it felt like being in a summer camp. Stuff was really friendly. I didn't like the insane amount of drop counters and needles in general, but our medical system uses them everywhere. Suicidal thoughts followed me everywhere. I wanted to move to another country or at least to another part of city to escape them, but I understood, that they are a part of me by now. First time in four years I've got a day, when I don't think about killing myself in a serious way. I feel so relieved. I feel lighter than air.",1
"Fell off the boat, relapsed back into depression, just a reminder for those that you should always be on top of your depression even when you don't feel it. Long story short, a few years ago I checked myself into an outpatient center to get my depression under control. It worked wonders and it was the best thing ive ever done for myself. After I got out, I was seeing a regular therapist however I was stuck in a toxic job that kept on triggering my depression and fucking up my recovery. Found a promising new job but that one ended up being even more toxic. Met my current bf at that time and he convinced me to quit and it was the only job I ever rage quit and told the people to fuck off. Felt good. Ended up being a great choice because I decided to get my CDL and it's been awesome so far. Really got my shit in gear, the job is fun as hell, I make really good money, it's challenging in all the right kind of ways where you get these little senses of accomplishment here and there. Me and my bf also have a home together and it's great. But back to my point about staying on your treatment. Sometime inbetween going from the one toxic job to the other, I stopped seeing my psychologist. I was losing my health insurance at the time but I was on such a high from getting this new job it didn't bother me. Long story short, went through that hole toxic episode and a severe down but I blamed it on the job and not the depression. Once I got my CDL I was actually feeling happy and great. Depression is an asshole though and knows how to creep back in. Now that I've been driving semis for close to 2 years, the job has gotten very routine and I started falling back into old thought processes, the ones were all familiar with. They start slow like a dropping pipe until the pipe eventually bursts so you really don't notice it. But they're there. That one small familiar though eventually grows routes until you relapse like I did and youre back in that dark place with no escape. That's where I'm at now, gotta almost start from 0 again. Luckily, I have much more control on it and know what to do but still, this is something you truly got to actively manage everyday even when you don't feel you need to because it will creep back up at some point. Just always stay active and watch the warning signs so you don't spiral. We can beat depression, but we all need to remember to stay active and progressive.",1
"I (19F) am having so much luck in my life!! I am so happy!!! Sorry for any mistakes, english isn’t my first language. My (19F) life is going so great at this moment. End 2020 and beginning 2021 were hard on me. I stopped at the university I was going to, mostly because it was draining me emotionally and physically. The time I spend was work or study and it just was all too much for me. End 2020 I got in contact again with an old colleague (21M). And well, since new years eve we’re officially together. We really had the honeymoon phase and we grew out of it, which was a pretty hard time. He went a little too far with a girl friend he hadn’t seen in a while at a party. So it wasn’t really a very hard time, but mostly emotionally draining and I was just tired of everything. But when I knew what kind of study I wanted to try next year, things suddenly got better. I’m going to study to become a math teacher. And in the country where I’m from, there is an enormous shortage of teachers. So I thought, why not send an open application to my old high school. You can always try! And I really wanted a different job, since my school is only one day in the week. Well, I got the job! I am a teacher next schoolyear! And I love it! So I am going to study for something I have passion for, and I will be working as the thing I’ve been dreaming about for years?!?? It is a life goal for me to achieve. My boyfriend and I made up after having a rough time and even had many dates and weekends away to get closer to each other. He is really a great guy and he is trying so hard to help me trust him. He suprises me with flowers time to time, he takes me out on dates, listens to my problems and is ALWAYS understanding of things I don’t feel great about. Our relationship is thriving! But it is even getting better. My boyfriend and I wanted to move out of our parents houses, but we couldn’t find anything and it was no priority. It isn’t really common here to move out when you are 18. My dad has a small rental house in his backyard (the literal translation for it is a “summerhouse” or as we call it a “zomerhuis”). And the girl who lives there, is moving. So me and my boyfriend are going to move in end of this month!!! We are renovating right now. And I just really wanted to share. My life really couldn’t have been any better. Great school, my dream job, my dream man and a house!",0

"How do you experience stress in your body? Hi there! I'm looking for survey participants for my grad school thesis project on the prevalence of different stress responses across the population. Since you are all interested in stress here, I thought you might be interested in participating in the project. Info is below. Thanks so much! Our laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh is conducting a research study to measure how people experience **stress**. If you are a US citizen or resident between the ages of 18-65 years old, you are eligible to participate! The study involves filling out some questionnaires about how stress manifests itself in your body. Depending on your unique stress response, the survey could take as little as 5 minutes or up to approximately 15 minutes to complete. To compensate you for completing the survey, you can choose to have your name entered for the opportunity to receive an iPad. You may also elect to do the survey as a volunteer without compensation (i.e., without having your name entered to receive an iPad). Some respondents may be invited to fill out the survey a second time at a later date and will again have the opportunity to receive compensation.

"High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water. But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems. Edit didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too. Edit 2 still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day.",1

"Does anyone else shower more often when they get stressed? This is something I've noticed myself doing often the last few years. When I'm stressed \(not always consciously\) I feel this really intense urge to shower more often and if I don't I feel really gross, as if I haven't showered in a week.

"Difficulty in breathing It's been many years since I've stressed about a lot of things which were out of my control and that damaged me in different ways like losing strength, muscle fragility etc. But last year I faced something which has slowed me a lot, as soon as I see myself getting close to a stressful situation let it be a argument with someone, I feel that something tight is being heavily pressed against my upper abs (where chest ends and stomach starts) and I'm unable to breathe. As a result I have to be in bed for hours till I get back to normal. This issue has started causing a lot of problem for me as I have to do lots of stuff but I'm unable to. Can anyone suggest any way by which this issue can be resolved or can happen less often?",1

"Looking forward to the next life... Anybody else looking forward to death? I am not suicidal, I have no desire to commit suicide - but I would welcome not being here anymore. I guess that's depression, right? I don't think I've ever been ""happy"", but I have had windows of happiness in my life. I'd say it's 90 10. 90% of my life has been torture, 10% has been happy. I'm already on Zoloft and Xanax. I don't know how much of my unhappiness is due to my life situation vs. it just being who I am. I'm married with 3 adult children, all of them are out of the house and doing okay (so far), but I really just want to be on my own in nature somewhere on the beach, not having to deal with my children or responsibilities. My wife and I are okay - sometimes. Sometimes I think she's sick of me. She wants to stay involved in their lives - I like their company and I love them - but I want them to do it all on their own. So, she and I fight about that. Like I said - other than the pain of dying, I'm not really too happy about sticking around here either.",1

"I managed to finally get my life together, and I am proud of it. I finally managed to persevere and spend this year improving my body and mind. And I am so proud of myself for it. I was skinny-fat my whole life, and was extremely ashamed of my body, to the point where although I lived right next to the sea, I would refrain from going since I had to show my skin. I have tried exercising my whole life, but never stuck to a routine and always ended up quitting after a few weeks as soon as my motivation dwindled. I subconsciously always felt embarrassed about not even being able to do a single proper push-up, and I knew I was disappointing my dad who was a man who grew up in the USSR where being able to do muscle ups at 15 years old was the norm. I had very low self esteem However, I am happy to say that I finally managed to persevere and stuck to a routine for the last 6 months, even keeping a clean diet during the process. What was different this time it’s that I finally had access to a gym, where I could surround myself with like-minded people having the same goals as me. Weight training has made me stronger to the point where I could do dozens of push-ups as well as multiple pull-ups, which I was never able to do before. Even for months after starting to exercise regularly, I still was too embarrassed to show my body, and often times didn’t go to party’s with friends if they involved a pool. However, today was the first day where I looked myself in the mirror and saw real progress, and smiled at myself proudly. I felt a lot of energy and motivation , seeing how far I’ve come.

Scared of sleeping because tomorrow will start Lately I’ve been neglecting sleep because I can’t overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things i’m behind on whether it’s school or even socially. It feels like when i’m awake a long period of time I can just manage my stress. Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping. Idk just feels like i’m trapped. EDIT I find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because I hate when people feel bad for me. I’ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but I always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems.,1

"Working on a production line, being the last guy, fucking up, and having to deal with ALL the other worker’s anger I work at an auto body shop. I’m the polisher/detailer, so my job is to polish the paint, right after it comes out of the booth, and get rid of any imperfections. Paint jobs will always have dirt in them, unless the booth is a total-vacuum, so you have to use a sander to lightly sand the surface (WITHOUT going thru the clear-coat) and cut that dirt out, then buff out the scratches after. It’s very difficult. I accidentally fucked up on a truck last week, and burnt through. The painter was upset, cause he had to redo that panel, but I was forgiven. Then today, I fucked up not once, but TWICE, on the same car. I’m very new, and still learning, so it’s understandable, but I still have to deal with the rest of the Shop getting pissed off at me. I am so stressed right now, I’m about to throw up. It’s not totally my fault. They are giving me inadequate tools, and the paint job could have been better, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s MY responsibility to make shit happen, regardless of circumstance, and the Shop doesn’t really take the tools/bad paint into consideration. So yeah, this car is gonna have to be repainted. And the painter works on commission, so he’s going to lose money because of me. Im crying and shit in my car on my lunch break.

Wasn’t expecting to be attacked on Reddit…the only form of “social media” that I have because others suck. Can’t even express my honesty without being downvoted without negative points. When I think someone makes fun of me and I had to call them out, then I’m the fucking bad guy. Depression, ptsd, and general anxiety fucking every last part of my old self. I would rather just die.",1
"Don't you love it when you're finally feeling okay and having a good time, and then a wave of loneliness washes over you, because you feel like everything you do is pointless, since there is no one to share it with I'm so fucking lonely. I can't do this anymore",1
"I think this life isn't for me I have a really hard time to speak to other ppl irl,I have made multiple attempts to visit a psych but I end up never going there,I used to use gaming as a way to escape my depression or reality all together but also did the mistake of getting into long distance relationships that ended up really fucking bad...which left me traumatized from ever trusting anybody be it irl or online,I have no friends nobody I can talk to and I think even if someone would want to be my friend i would never accept or open up to them. I feel like I am stuck and there is no escape,I am 23 turning 24 next month,I feel like it's over for me,i'll die alone without friends or anyone by my side,dissapointing my parents by never getting married or having a kid,dissapointing anyone in my family by being not normal,everyone has told me i am not normal but what is being normal even?I am losing the fun in games,I am losing the last thing that is keeping me alive,what will happen to me if the games I used as a way to escape can't help me escape anymore?I'm convinced i am fucked",1
"Suffering is the design of this senseless, heartless universe! Yesterday I saw a facebook video in which a deer who was caught by a leopard was howling continuously in pain.

"What the hell is wrong with me? I'm constantly stressed, often from the moment I wake up. Everything I do makes it worse, doing nothing makes it worse. Sometimes I'll be able to distract myself but the moment the distraction stops the stress starts at high intensity. Nothing makes it go away. Breathing exercises make it worse. Exercise helps briefly, as in the moment I sit down after maybe an hour of exercise, but after a few seconds it starts up again.",1
"Hopefully this helps a few people! I've been very stressed out/anxious over the past 2-3 months and I tried something that worked. I read somewhere about eating a few balls of black peppercorn to fight stress and tried it out yesterday for the first time. Within about 20 minutes I started feeling pretty calm, then 2 hours I was like damn I feel pretty good and relaxed this is great, and by the end of the night I felt like I could accomplish anything. I was motivated, working on a ton of things I had to do around the house, playing with dog, and staying busy. Felt the best I had in a long time. I ate a few more today and I'm on top of the world again. I hope it helps at least a few of ya'll! Cheers",1
Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. ,1
"Is this normal? Idk, I just feel stressed. Online classes are boring. Internships are stressful, nobody calls me back. I overthink every single email and urgh, it's just frustrating. I wish I could just live peacefully in some mountain with my own chickens and sheep. After all, humans were supposed to live in tribes.

"I sold my guns. They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons. My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic. ""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?"" This is shit I do not need running through my mind. Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon. So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store. I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000. Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner... ""What if I just went up there and--"" Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures? I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though. I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself. It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected. -=-=- (also posted in /r/getting_over_it, if it's not allowed to post in two subs, let me know and I'll delete.)",1
Money I just can’t believe how money can make you stress so deep in your core because you have shit to pay for but you have no money to pay for it. I just don’t have what to do. I work and I work and I work but I still don’t have enough money for anything,1

"I fantasize about a social life in my head I have full conversations with friends I don't have, about stories I haven't lived. I imagine how they'd respond and laugh at my jokes. I don't have any real friends, I spend my life alone because I have no real confidence in myself. I feel my youth wasting away and I hate who I am. I am unemployed so I couldn't have moved out from home. I imagine myself as a successful athlete (I know it's stupid) and I imagine how I'd interact with people and the questions they'd ask. It's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago. I wish I could escape into my fantasies",1
"Why is stress so debilitating? I'm sorry if my formatting isn't great, I'm writing this on a mobile. I came home from food shopping around two hours ago and after a short period of time noticed that my dog, Claude had chewed through the blind in the living room. He hasn't been destructive in the short amount of time I've had him so it really threw me. It may not seem like much, but I saved for a little while to get the blind and when I saw it I just broke down into sobs. This isn't supposed to be a 'woe is me' post but something so small has sent me into a tailspin. Whenever I get stressed or something bad happens, (usually relating to money) my go to emotion is abject negativity. Not intentionally but all I saw is black and something minor can ruin my mood for the whole day, sometimes even days at a time. I don't have any other coping mechanisms other than to completely shut down. Claude is a new addition to my home after I lost my two previous pups only three months apart. I know he hasn't done it to upset me, dogs don't think or act that way but it hasn't stopped me from crying. Money is always so tight here and I just didn't need this right now.",1
"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days. Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days. I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway! I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free! I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?! I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?) Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!) The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself) This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city. I’m so proud of myself! Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay) I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time! I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me busy. I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years! I feel alive. // Anton",1

"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling. I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right? So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit.",1

"Feeling stuck Feeling I’m stuck in both my work and personal life. I have a well paid but stressful job. In the first a few years, I voluntarily worked hard for a faster promotion and a better pay. After some successful projects, however, I don’t see a very clear goal. I’d always wanted to move to a management role, but there is no opening. So, I need to continue my current role that has gradually become repetitive for me. Without a clear motivation, the high work load easily turns me into a burnout mode. My relationship with my partner is complicated as well. After spending many years together and going through some very tough periods, the relationship is more or less stable but I can clearly feel the anxiety to be with my partner sometimes, as the goal is just to go through the day without irritating each other. I can’t say how much love and communications we have between each other. A sleepless night. Just trying to vent out …",1

Apparently science is optional instead of being true and anyone who believes in science is a sheep who needs to check themselves against a facebook mom's Google search.

Usually I'll wait until I start sweating and can't think clearly to start eating. Do I need to break that habit to heal my thyroid? How often should I eat?

"The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly. If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me.

"Looking for advice - worried about SO's health Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons. I'm (m30) really worried about my SO's (f29) health and could really do with some advice. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom. I'm not sure if any of this content may be triggering, so I apologise if it is. Some context - we have been together nearly 10 years; lived together for 6. Before that, we did long distance for 2 years. Long distance was hard, and during that time my SO was going through what she calls a ""hypochondriac stage"", in which she was always worrying about her health and scared she was going to get ill. After we moved in together, that worry subsided and things were ok. I suffer from mild anxiety too, so we both had our bouts every now and then, but great other than that. She would always think very low of herself though, especially her appearance and her weight. Whenever we went anywhere, 9/10 times she would have a break down about what she would be wearing, which often made us late or led to an argument or general stress. Fast forward a few years. Just before Covid, she suffered the loss her step mother, who wasn't even 50. This was obviously devastating, but did lead to her and her dad becoming closer. Then Covid hit, and as such she has never fully had time to grieve for her step mum. On top of that, in June, her dad announced that he had met someone else. In November, he said they were moving in together. Two weeks ago, he announced they were getting married. The way that he announced all of these was either very nonchalantly (over Zoom/phone call) or in a very grandiose way, expecting congratulations I'm sure. Obviously, my SO (and her sister) are appalled, and her dad doesn't quite seem to understand why. On top of that, he is so wrapped up in his own life, that he isn't taking the time to ask how my SO/her sister are feeling about. It's very messed up, and I'm furious at him. So that's two reasons why she is feeling particularly stressed at the moment. The third is work. We are both key workers, and as such have been going into work throughout the last year when others were WFH. On top of that, her work has been insanely busy and she is working on average 11 hour days, and the work still isn't done. The team she manages are not pulling their weight and management, from what I can gather, seem quite useless and keep promising solutions but never deliver. She doesn't want to quit, mainly because finding a job in this uncertain climate will be stressful too, and in the somewhat likely event that redundancies are made, it'll probably be a first in, first out situation. Her day of anxiousness usually goes as follows - Wake up feeling stressed about work and about what to wear - will sometimes have a break down. At work, overloaded with workload - will go to the bathroom to cry. In the evening, will come home stressed after a bad day. At night, will worry about sleeping and as a result will often have a big break down if she can't sleep/gets woken up. ",1

"I don't know how to stay positive with the chronic illness I'm going through The last year, but specifically it became severe the last 2 months..I have severe GERD and LPR. I've been in pain constantly, my sleep has sucked. It hurts to speak, it hurts to breathe, every meal I eat is basically a time bomb. If I mess up and have anything remotely acidic (even a minor ingredient), my esophagus begins digesting itself and I can see sores develop that still haven't healed. It's hard to eat, my diet is restrictive, it hasn't helped, I'm young and healthier than most .. This is bullshit I'm on the strongest meds they have to suppress acid (PPI). At this point I really think surgery is my only hope, if you can even call it that. Reading stories online lots of people had great success, but others have been left with the same symptoms It's been a recent dream to sing, I want to be able to finally express myself especially considering my damaged childhood. But my stupid body is falling apart and I can't unless this gets fixed. I know it can transform my life and it's what my heart is dying for but I need this to get fixed I don't know how to stay positive here anymore. I don't know how people can do this, deal with a chronic illness. My social life is gone, my days consist of watching TV , trying to eat between the pain and counting down the day until the next doctor test, hoping for an answer but they just say ""yep, let's order this next test see you in 3 weeks mother fucker"". That and they act like surgery isn't a good fix, which translates to me as ""you have no hope"". I wish I were fat because then I could at least lose weight and get it fixed that way I'm not going to live like this, I want it all or nothing. I need to be able to sing and this whole thing just makes me so mad and defeated. And it pisses me off that I'm so healthy but genetics or whatever just wants to ruin my life.

"What is wrong with me? Hey! I don't know if I'm on the right subreddit, so I just ask you guys. I don't know what's wrong with me. I barely enjoy things anymore, I can't motivate me to do anything. For example I'm overweight and I really want to lose weight and eat healthier but I can't motivate myself to get up. I can't even enjoy Movies and Video games as much a I used to. Most of the time I just want to lay on the couch and smoke weed. I don't have any friends either, so I don't have a lot of people I can talk to. I don't know what to do anymore.",1

"Birthday in a few days and I just don’t want to be here anymore. I’m pass done My 24th Birthday is coming up this week and I just don’t see how I’m going to make it through it if that makes sense. This year or these last few years in general have been a living hell for me and I’m tired. Ive had constant headaches everyday for the past 8 months, I’m not financially stable at all and I don’t even have enough money to do anything at all for my birthday. I’m to the point where I just want to pretty much end it all. If putting a bullet through my own head was easy I would have been done it. My birthday coming up and me in my current mental state just feels like a nail in the coffin.",1
Stress is... ..remaining stationary while processing thoughts like a factory. ...undoing a yarn ball. ...skating on a half-melted pond. ...trying and failing to fit a square in a circle. ...separating the chocolate from the milk. ...a two-steering wheel car. ...the very bottom of the mountain. ...an island of salvation. ...a malfunctioning computer. ...a dog tugging on the leash. ...never resurfacing. ...the warning of the garbage truck. ,1
"Just got dumped My girlfriend for 7,5 years just dumped me because “its hard to live with somebody that is always depressed” and because she has more intrest in another man. This is probably the closest ive ever gotten to ending my own life. I just dont see why i should continue. Edit thanks for all of the kind words, i really do appriciate them. Right now, about 6 hours after it happend i still feel like my world had ended and that i wanne end it all. I’ve been trying to do something to keep my mind busy but everything that i do atm, makes me think of her. I will be fine someday i hope. Edit edit i wanne thank everybody who commented,liked, private messaged, and awarded. When i saw her leave and i knew I couldn’t call her mine anymore i really really wanted to die, i was close to do something i would regret. I still have those feelings but thanks to everybody here im sure im not gonna act up on those thoughts. Please everybody when my post faded away, keep helping people in this sub the way you helped me. P.s. stop making me cry every time.",1
"Casually Suicidal Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all. ",1

"I'm going out with my ""celebrity crush""! The title is pretty self-explanatory. Just to clarify, she's not like a CELEBRITY, but I don't know what else to call her. She used to sing in a band that was once quite popular in this area, but has since disbanded and she's now a bit off the radar. She's a bit older than I am, but we've had this cool communication over the messages through the years, which started by me hitting her up as a fan, but has since grown to become quite friendly. We live a bit far apart, but I'm going to travel close to her soon, so I decided to (bravely) hit her up and ask to meet her, to which she said yes and was really, really nice. Like, don't get me wrong, it's not a date or anything, but I'm really excited, because her music really helped me through the years, inspired my own works and I've followed her for a very long time, since she seems like a really fun, interesting and awesome person - and I can't wait to have the privilege to have a few drinks with her. Due to her low radar status, I'll respect her and not share her identity here, just so it doesn't cause an awkward situation or ruin anything. I'm excited, happy and I hope she turns out to be na awesome person!",0

Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take. I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison. I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff. I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything. Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal. I just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore..",1

"Inside the earth When describing my depression, it changes every now and again depending how I am ATM. Today is pretty bad, physically it feels like someone is stepping on my chest with the heaviest boot they have and pressing as hard as possible. Emotionally it feels like I'm in a deep dark pit in the earth . All I can do is look up only being able to see a bit of sky. The only way I know that time is passing is by the color changes of the sky. I'm alone and time seems to both drag and disappear. I'm not great right now",1
"New job stress I have a new part time job at a restaurant and I'm stressed about a few things 1) I'm going to start training to be a kitchen manager. I'm 17 and have never had a job before, so this is a bit intimidating. Though the pay will be nice. 2) a girl I'm training with (the restaurant hasnt opened yet and I applied for a general position, was chosen by a trainer for the promotion) really wants this position and I dont want to make things awkward. 3) they're kind of pushing these labor laws. I'm working shifts that are past midnight and between 6.5 and 8 hours for 5 days in a row. That would be fine if I didnt have school and could drive. But they're really up to the limit. So, I guess I'm just asking for advice.

I just needed somewhere to write things down, and there’s no place is better than a public forum. Hopefully someone out there will relate, although I’m not sure anyone can help. I have little to no work at the moment thanks to the virus, I have an exhibition planned in a different city next month that I feel unprepared for, I have an essay due next month as well that I’m struggling with, and my pc (no which all this relies) decided to crash last night. It works now, but the sudden instability threw me, and I feel like it could happen again at any moment. I’m not spiraling, but my body is so run down. If I could get in gear to do some work then I could maybe work through it, my stress is usually around not meeting deadlines.

"I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives. I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult. I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess. But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there. I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work. So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone. I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need. I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move. It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know. It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing. I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable. I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself. I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now. I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that? I am not ok with it at all. Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it. We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way. I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression. It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong. Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe. I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should. thanks",1

"Strong language warning. Don’t let past failure destroy future success Well I’m getting ready for the military at an older age than most seem to join. At 25. I’m stressed about getting my mind and body in shape. I’m not out of shape but there’s been a lot of brain fog lately. I’ve not been myself. Kinda depressed. Social life has really been zero. And I’m not exaggerating. I live with my aunt and uncle. I see some older retired neighbors like twice a week but I’ve really not talked with ANYONE in my age group for half a year or more. My family isn’t really available either so that’s been kinda strange. Just Mentally haven’t been great. And I don’t want that to determine future success. No friends. No relationships. Nothing fun. I recently lost my job because I broke my elbow. There was some dispute with me and the boss over a “performance issue”. I stood my ground. It wasn’t my fault. I’m still healing but I took a major blow to my esteem because of it and it ruined the few friendships I seemed to have in the company. They didn’t see my strongest self during my last few days. I’ll explain what I can, just scroll by if not applicable but I broke elbow while putting up caution tape and using a ladder. (Go ahead lol). I worked for an entire week with a sling on. Doc told me to stop working but we had a fuckin project that was up for orientation and one of the pm’s was outta town so it was intense. I didn’t once whine about it. But one of the days the boss saw me picking up materials fit someone else and I guess it looked I wasn’t working hard enough. Assumed I was slacking. Followed me without talking to me and ended up blowing up because I showed up the next day with a full dump truck and a broom(I filled two full dump truck loads by myself with one fuckin arm) so naturally I couldn’t really be of use to anyone. I also was trying to empty it at the dump but the boss freaked out on me and said I needed to be back at the site. Pretty much prevented me from doing my job. Yeah I agreed and acknowledged my faults but on top of all this I had to move out of my house in two days during this time. Worked as a construction specialist in training but that’s now gone to shit. I want to resume training/studying so I can just leave for the military. But I can’t even run or swim because it’ll apparently put shock on the fracture.

"I feel like I'm suffocating I don't know if it's relevant for this post, I'm a 27-year-old woman. My ex of (almost) seven years, broke up with me 5 months ago. We weren't happy, and I think that my diagnosis (Personality disorder(s) with comorbid depression and other stuff), helped him with that decision. Because of that, I had to move back to my parents, I can't afford to live alone because my therapy consumes a good chunk of my salary. I feel like I'm suffocating like I have this pressure on my chest and throat. It's hard to breathe. I'm constantly on the verge of crying, not because I miss my ex, but because I have this feeling, or rather I'm sure that my life is and is going to be miserable. I see no future and hope for myself. I have enough of my life, this neverending vicious cycle, the same routine everyday. I wake up, get dressed, go for a walk with my dog, work, go for a walk, exercise, walk the dog. Everyday is the same. I eat the same food, wear the same clothes, nothing changes. Or rather I don't change, but everything around me is constantly changing, and I am stuck, slowly suffocating, barely being able to pull my shit together. I'm in this place right now, that I would give anything to be able to feel anything, I want to get drunk, high, just to feel something different. I want to meet new people, have affairs, travel, disappear. But I can't... I'm stuck in the ivory tower, my prison, my room. I try to get out more, be more sociable, but every time I match with someone on a dating app I begin to feel so heartbroken (?) like I know that nothing will ever come out of this because I'm too scared to get out of my room and go on a date. I fear, that they will not like me, find me attractive enough. That's why I stick to texting and ghosting people when they ask me out. I know it's horrible. But I can't help it. I'm a failure, yet I'm so frightened to be perceived as one. And I know that I'm quite good-looking, in good shape, and I can be fun to be around. But lately, I feel like a potato sack, unattractive, with nothing to offer. I feel like I'm going to end up all alone, resenting everyone, because they have something, that I won't ever get - happiness and peace of mind.

"Initiated a fun conversation with a stranger, and overcame a fitness fear. I'm feeling really good as I'm writing this, I am genuinely proud of how I handled myself these past two days - in two separate situations. Trying to get over a bit of a slump, so I forced myself to go on more walks around the city and parks to hit 10,000 steps every day. It's been a really fun atmosphere around the city this weekend because we have the arts festival and pride celebrations both going on in Pittsburgh right now. Yesterday, I saw a cute girl sitting by herself and after reminding myself ""regret is worse than rejection"" I went over and started a conversation with her. The chat was entertaining, easy, light, we learned a bit about each-other and got to have a simple pleasant conversation with hundreds of people walking around the park near us. This was the first time I've approached a girl to talk since my 4 year relationship ended. When she and I had to head our separate ways to get to work after about 30 minutes, I scribbled my number down on a piece of paper and gave it to her. It's been well over a day now and she hasn't contacted me and at this point I'm guessing probably won't but that's OKAY! I'm still incredibly happy that I proved to myself I can still engage in a conversation with a stranger, and have the confidence to go start a chat, and handle myself throughout. Please don't interpret this as a silver lining sort of thing, because it's completely fine if we never talk again, I'm happy about the fact I shut up all those negative worried voices and just walked up to someone and said hi. That's a win for me! Then, this afternoon I was feeling really good after my workout, and had just got my new running shoes in the mail that morning, so I wanted to go for a short run to try them out! I've always been self conscious about my weird abb genetics, mine don't line up nicely across from one another, and I have some light remnants of bacne from when I was a teenager, 25 now. It's 90 degrees full sun in the city right now, so I rode that happiness I was still feeling from the previous day, lathered up in sunscreen and went for my first run ever without my shirt on. I ran along the water and ended up at point park, and then walked home to recover through the arts festival and into the city. While I was walking home some guy in a white truck was yelling ""hey buddy buddy buddy buddy"" out of his window until I turned to look at him, in case I something had fallen out of my pocket or he was needing directions, at which point he shouted ""put a shirt on"" and drove off. I smiled so hard, and I've felt amazing since then. That would have destroyed me like hearing ""chicken legs"" when I was a ball boy for the soccer team at 13, but now It was the best compliment I could have gotten. This jealous turd was so uncomfortable with where he is at physically that he felt the need to get my attention and try to shame me. I felt wonderful, I know I have my flaws, but I also know I look pretty decent, and it was really validating. Again, this isn't something bad where I'm seeing the silver lining, but a genuine sign that I've really grown and can handle that with the knowledge that I look good and I'm doing well! It realllllllly also showed me the truth of that notion that if you've already had a success of some sort early in your day, hardships later sluff off more easily. I knew I already crushed chest and calves that morning, and had a good run, so I could take this on the cheek. All in all it's also been a fantastic example that happiness can compound, and you can use each little nugget to fuel you on to do something else, I'm going to keep going and try to work on getting that every day.

"I just want to stay home I’m an essential worker at a job that made me miserable even before this covid-19 situation. The past month has been really stressful for me because it’s 3x as busy these days. I get really frustrated and my coworkers probably get frustrated at me too because I’m relatively new to the job. I just feel like I have no clue what I’m doing half the time and it scares me. I want to quit but I have a ton of student loans and the job market is extremely saturated. I’ve been unsuccessful in trying to find another job in my field and the thing is, I don’t think I even want a job in my field. Unfortunately I can’t afford to go back to school to pursue another career and I wouldn’t be able to pay my loans if I worked a minimum wage job. I feel trapped. I don’t have a lot of people I can talk to about this. Thanks internet for listening to my rant.",1

"Have family member with Alcoholism & depression... Need help I have a family member who is struggling terribly. She's had some major life changes, including losing her marriage, and has sunk terribly into alcoholism and depression. She's been a drinker for over 30 years, but I think she's been a functional alcoholic for the last decade or so. Now that she's had these difficult life changes I believe her drinking got out of control and for at least the last few months I think she's been drinking (wine, near exclusively) and eating almost nothing. For me, one of my biggest problems is I don't know what to attribute to drinking and what to depression. She's more or less lost all of her will to live and her fight... She's lost interest in basically everything and is also showing signs of being confused and mentally""off"". The situation deteriorated to the to point where her house was in disrepair and her lower legs have atrophied to the size of an average forearm or wrist. I believe she's also having problems with incontinence. Because of the state of her legs she's not able to walk. She spent a week in a psych ward though is home now, but when she went (involuntarily) she was very out of her normal mind and was trying to hit/bite family members and was very much not herself. I'm not doing a very good job at describing the situation, but I've got to be honest, I really want to help out, but I am completely out of my depth here and don't know how to even get started. Also, she has been in the hospital twice recently for medical work ups and after scans came back clean she was always sent home with the doctors pointing squarely at alcoholism/depression as the source of everything.

I want to finish my degree because that’s what he wants me to do and I also want that but he doesn’t understand how difficult it is to study while trying constantly to not fall in that depressive pit all the time. Depression also gave chronic pains that are also a constant distraction.

Opening up is bs So I opened up to my therapist and the lad I work with about my suicidal thoughts.my therapist said there's other organisations I can talk to if I ever feel like acting on my thoughts and that I should contact a Dr and get antidepressants which I can't because there's only one I can have and I tried them before they didn't help and the lad I work with said that there's people who have it worse and that I should leave it at home or something it's affecting my work the work I do is poor and slow I don't know what to do anymore I'm probably gonna end up getting fired soon I'm so tired,1
"Journal for nobody probably. Sorry for this long and messy ""rant"", I just wanted to write this down and maybe someone might read it and share their thoughts about this with me. I often feel alright but then I feel really blue... Idk I am just really pessimistic about the world itself and about me myself... Idk where to start, sorry. What's there to say abt why I'm sad about the state of the world...pretty obvious. We're all on a way towards a dystopia and there's no way preventing it...I always dreamt of a utopic future, of a space society sort of thing. I know it sounds stupid but I always wanted something like that. Like a feeling humanity is destined for greater than where we are going but we are not. I also can't bear the thought of living my life to work for 40-50 years from now to get little highs in my freetime... With me myself it's...weird... I feel depressed but I also feel like I'm not depressed enough to get help. Even posting this feels kinda insulting to people here that feel way worse than me. Like I got basically almost everything to be happy so why am I not? I simultaneously love and hate myself. Like I think I'm a good person and stuff but I also hate my inconsequence on...anything. I wanted to quit smoking, I got a vape. I wanted to work out and get healthier, then I waste away in my room playin games and watching the same stuff over and over to get comfortable in familiarity... I want to play the guitar yet I don't practise at all because Id rather play games...I also want to get a partner again but I've left my dating app untouched since I installed it. Never even made a profile. It's always the same shit. ""Tomorrow for sure"" and then I don't. And if I manage to, I stop after a few days. It got even worse since I got busted for marihuana use half a year ago. Weed was always this kind of safe haven to me. I could waste away without remorse and only felt depressed occasionally. And then I'd just smoke a head and thought of something else. Since I got busted I live basically the same life but without this weed distraction. Also now because the bust I gotta fear my apprenticeship and feel like I have to prove something to my employers just to keep the privilege to work there anymore. I can't drive to work or to school anymore for at least the next half year and feel like I'm an inconvenience to my parents cuz they need to drive me everywhere now. Even tho they say it's no big deal and have generally been really supportive. But I also don't want to tell them exactly how I feel because I feel like I wouldn't deserve this extra worry from my parents as they've already did so much for me. I've felt really bad this eve and I just wanted to cry but I couldn't. I just feel shit but not like crying. I just want the time back when I didn't have to worry abt this shit. And even if I feel better tomorrow my motivation won't change and I will continue to waste away...I've thought abt phoning our insurance to ask if theyd cover some sort of therapy just to get advice but I'm scared they won't. I'm also scared I just won't call because I don't feel like it again. I just want to get away. Go on an adventure. I'd love for a DrWho to land with a tardis in front of me and take me on a giant adventure into space and time. Away from work and responsibilities but still in reach of my parents and the people I love. Sorry for this long ass text if anyone even reads it. I just needed to get this off my chest.",1

"I may not be “unlovable”. But I’m pretty sure I’m incapable of feeling loved. My parents were pretty emotionally distant and demanding growing up. My dad was a military man, and a preacher. He had very specific ideas about the right way to do basically everything, and preached to us ad nauseam the importance of righteousness. My mom was… in hindsight I would say she was probably dealing with some trauma herself. She’s not a nurturing person, despite being the stay at home mother who raised me and my brothers and sisters. When my wife and I started dating, she had to initiate physical contact. Hugging was never something my family ever did growing up. When I went to college and people were hugging each other, I was honestly confused. It’s become this joke in our marriage about how she had to teach me how to hug. Rationally, I know there are people in my life who love me. My parents would say they love me, though they have always been abysmal at expressing that in any meaningful way. I’m sure my wife loves me, though it seems like half the time we’re just tolerating each other, or too busy coping with the firehose of bullshit that is adult life. I have three kids. I’m sure they love me, though it really feels like most of the time I’m with them they are literally screaming at me. I guess I have friends who would probably say they love me, but I don’t really see any friends ever. My siblings would say they love me. I don’t see them very often. While writing this, my son came up and asked if we could cuddle. I should feel warmth at this. I put my kids to bed tonight. They all hugged and kissed me and told me they loved me. But I just don’t feel it. I feel tired and empty. My brain doesn’t feel or think positive, nice things about itself. I really, really don’t have those neural pathways. I also don’t know what to do about that. I don’t like myself, or enjoy my life.",1

"My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him. Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing . I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed . Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ... His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed, it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me . That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.

"Opening up “too much” Hi everyone, I need so advice or words of encouragement I already feel bad enough with myself. I feel like I have made a mistake and potentially messed up something good. I recently met this guy on tinder, I have never been a fan of the app and my conversations don’t usually last long with anyone. But this guy and I clicked instantly, we both want the same things, are very similar and there seems to be a lot of chemistry. Where I’m from, we are in lockdown. We started talking two weeks ago and haven’t met yet, been talking everyday pretty much all the time. I had some bad things happening the last two days, my dog got very sick and had to take her to emergency vets, I was distraught and terrified of losing her. Then my parents told me they’re divorcing. Anyway so that plus my depression, bipolar, anxiety and other mental health issues I have found the last two days really rough. So I opened up to this guy, he’s been really understanding, comforting and has really been the best. However I opened up about some serious stuff about my past, overdosing, and other things. I feel like I have opened up too much. I have extreme anxiety I possibly have messed this up. I know we haven’t been talking long and it terrifies me that I’ll lose him because I just dumped all my shit on him. I didn’t mean to, I was just being honest and he encouraged me to talk about it, but I don’t think he knew how serious it’d be. I told him I would talk to him tomorrow because I didn’t want him to think I was doing this to make him feel bad for me or for attention. I have pushed away people after opening up, I guess it all was too much for them to handle. He just said “oh” and reassured me I was being silly and it was okay. But that was it, I asked him if he was mad and he said no, I asked if we were good and he said yes. After that he just said good night and that he hoped I felt better and had a good sleep. Have I messed this up? My anxiety is telling me so and I don’t want to mess it up, I regret so much opening up. I knew it’d be too much but he insisted and don’t think he was ready to hear it all. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Thank you if you’ve made it this far through my post",1
"Tips on calming down? School starting soon once more, and this is my graduating semester. I just saw my schedule, and it is packed with double unit days amounting to 4 hours per subject in a single day for for the entire week.

"doing the best I can' I know people mean well when they say this too me, I'm struggling with a lot of issues these days. If the way I'm handling things is literally the best I can be then that's just not good enough. I can't keep going on like this but what else can be done? There's only so many hours in the day and so much energy in the tank, add self destructive behaviours to the mix and I'm screwed. This isn't a cry for help BTW, I'm just stuck, trapped and hurting myself and others along the way. Very tempted to just buy a one way ticket to the other side of the world and start again from nothing.",1
"New Job Good Day. I just got promoted to a brand new section at work. I went from being the top producer in my division to going over to a completely new division and I started in a supervisory role. I’m very lost. I know generally about what I’m supposed to be doing, but I feel like such a disappointment because I can’t answer my employees questions. Every single thing I see is brand new to me and I get so stressed out because I have a limited support system of people to ask questions to. Everyone is working from home so I can’t even have the luxury of learning a little bit by walking around and interacting with my people. I like the people, but a lot of them are low performers so I have to start with corrective actions before too long. All the other supervisory roles are vacant so I’m doing work for 3 teams. And my boss is new as well so I can’t really go to her, because she doesn’t know the answer either. I’m so stressed and every single day I get about 20 small fires I need to put out and several large fires and I have no idea how to solve any of them. Nobody has offered any training materials or support so I have had to find them all myself. The worst part is I put in for a supervisory position in my own division, but I was pulled over to this team because there were so many vacancies. So I have to do admin work for a huge team, start hiring processes, start performance appraisals (Despite me only being there 2 weeks), I sign off on all their work (I don’t know for sure if they’re doing everything right, but I simply don’t have the time to check everything and ask questions about everything), I get escalated all of the tough things and I get all the heat when things aren’t going great. Bottom line, I am so stressed out and every day after work I cry because I feel so terrible and I just sit there sad and eating unhealthy food because my energy has been sucked and my motivation is gone. I had such a relaxing (although boring) job before and in trying to expand my horizons I’ve landed in a personal hell. I hate every second of being alive right now and any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks.",0

I never talk to anyone- just listen to my music and try to do whatever, but today this random girl asked me if I was doing okay because I looked more down than usual. i told her ‘im good - thanks though”! i knew I felt myself getting worse and I guess it’s showing too. i guess it’s nice that someone asked though, even if i lied.",1

"Almost beat that shit (advices) Hi to all my soldiers. This is my first post on this media and I want to share you my shitty last 8 months (since the start of 2021 btw) of life. On November 2020, I've been diagnosed with a dep' because my life fucked up as a student, courses were annoying af, finding an internship was terribly hard, I argued a lot with my friends and I lived alone in my small flat what a beautiful life. I first didn't consult a specialist because I thought it was useless (**BIG MISTAKE**), so I dig down more and more. On February 2021, I felt terribly bad and my meds didn't help much, so I went to emergencies because I wanted to die. Nothing was worth to stay alive. I have been admitted to a psychiatry center for 1week, it was cool but I fell again when I came back. This time, I knew I wanted to fight. My family and friends were not worthy (not helping at all), everything in my life was flavorless, but I think we don't precisely search to die, we want to live in a different way. The 5-6 following months were terrible. I live in a countryside so I went to cry in a field 3 times a day, I spent every single fucking day alone in my pain. To feel better, I decided to act on the cycle ""Sleep - Nutrition - Exercise"" (I messed up in all these aspects), so I tried to sleep early and planned an alarm at 11am at first, tried to force my body to eat at each meal and I tried to exercise a minimum (walking, running, etc). With time, my body used to this and I reached a better health form. **This was not natural, I needed to force myself every fucking days**. Now, 8 months later, I'm still alone at home, I didn't contact my school yet but I feel better. I can cook, I can exercise, I can enjoy a book I can live by myself. I even did a hike trip alone in my region during 1 week. Time isn't hurting anymore. I still feel lonely but it is a hard problem to solve. I want to share you the key points that made a difference during my recovery * visit a psychiatrist please and take the meds (the role of this doc isn't to ""help you"", he just asks you the right questions because you are your own doc and he wants you to do it by yourself). * let your phone off (social media killed me a lot, plus I wanted my friends to be helpful but they can't. You're friends can't help you (execpt if they lived this shit) * keep very close friends to your side (maybe they can't help, but they can help you to live some ""neutral"" moments, instead of suffering alone in your home). I didn't respect that point... * plan an activity to do (cultural, manual, etc) * have a walk in a natural space (several times a week, even if it seems hard. Your brain need to breath fresh air buddy) * accept your feelings. Listen to your sadness and try to understand what it says. * keep a daily journal. It helps a lot to exteriorize your feelings, telling everything you think about you, people, life in general. It helped me everyday during my hard time. This is only my experience and you'll probably don't relate to everything, but please, contact a specialist and take care of you. The process is long, you need to be patient but your life will be better afterwards. Depression is terrible, it's like visiting a remote dark place alone while we are thousands and hundreds people here. But depression will teach you many positive things once your mind will be clear to see the world. You'll be very enthusiastic to enjoy just a piece of chocolate compared to others because you know how it feels to not feel pleasure at all during several months or years. I give you all my support and do not forget that you're not alone and PEOPLE LOVE YOU, they do man. Love you all from my french country.",1
"I wish I was never born. Life is a load of fucking bullshit. I hate being alive. I fucking hate it. I'm miserable all the fucking time and no matter how hard I try to make things better for myself it never fucking works. I'm just so tired of everything and I'm sick of trying my best when I know it's all going to amount to nothing. There's no point in anything, no point in finding friends, no point in falling in love and getting married. Why does being happy even matter if we're all just going to fucking die anyway?",1
"I accidentally landed into a great group of friends this year Man this is a rant but I'm happy and I just wanna share the story. So, making friends as an adult can be pretty hard. Don't get me wrong, I have friends from high school and that I grew up with, but it's also hard to align all our schedules to hang out, or people move, or you just grow distant. My own roommate I barely see because we work opposite schedules! But ONE person I kept in touch with, for some reason. We worked at a shitty bar when we were 18, they moved to another state, but we were well acquaintanted, not really even actual friends. And then they moved back like 7 years later and we caught up, acknowledging how odd it is that we stayed in touch. And then, out of ANYTHING, they posted on Snapchat about if anyone wanted to play *Among Us.* And I joined in, much to the mild chagrin of THEIR friend group who immediately were like ""Who the FUCK is TheVampirate?"" But for a time this was how I got to know them all, eventually even landing in their actual group chat. This goes on for 2 months and, as they also all lived in the same general area, invited me to a house party. I show up late to a series of goofy drunkards who all lined up and asked me ""Guess who everyone is!"" Such a silly game for a first impression. I did okay. And it's all been uphill since that. I've gotten to know them all pretty well we go out every week to the same bar, we have themed parties every month, constant random outings for food or park trips, deep and meaningful late-night convos, SO many photos - it's just, fun! A group of mid-late 20-somethings just living up their lives! It doesn't even matter that I only showed up a few months ago, or that some of them have been friends through high school or even elementary - they've basically adopted me in like I've always been there. It's not always perfect of course but, I mean, it's pretty damn good! This group really works. And my heart and soul feel a fullness that I wasn't even aware was missing until now. All through sheer coincidence more than anything. Funny how that works! Serendipity or whatever. Yeah, I don't have a good way to end this. I just wanted to share some wholesomeness that's been going on since the beginning of this year. Thanks for reading!",0
“I can’t try to commit suicide tonight because if I fail and survive I have work in the morning.” That’s the scariest/most pathetic thought that runs through my brain on work nights.

"Can anybody relate? I’ve been depressed for years now but about a year ago I developed a routine of numbness. Everyday is just a day, no feelings just trying to make it to the next day. I struggle to concentrate and motivate myself to doing better career wise and in my personal life. I also struggle with anxiety, If I even go out grocery shopping I feel that everything isn’t real or sometimes I get anxious but at end of the night I zone out into this dark place where I feel alone, back into depression. I’ve given up, I have no interest in anything I’m just trying to stay alive at this point. I should be happy with what I have since I do consider myself fortunate to have what I have but I’m not I’m just laying around watching the clock never stop. I’m not sure how to pull myself out, I’m not asking anyone to do it for me just asking if anyone relates?",1

"College Stress Hey! I'll try to make this as simple as possible. I'm a predental student in my first year of college. Currently living at home due to corona. Last semester quite literally destroyed me. Calc and chem at the same time sucked (mainly just calc in general), but I ended up with an A in calc and an A- in chem. But getting those grades also made me lose about 12 pounds (I was only 130 to begin with), I lost so much hair from not eating, I got dumped my by boyfriend since I ""stress out too much"", and I upset a lot of people close to me since I spent so much time complaining about things that in reality aren't even that bad. I should be grateful I even have the privilege to go to school, yet I spend most of my time crying about ""having"" to do it. I told myself I would do better this semester. Up until yesterday I have. I haven't thrown up before any tests like I used to. But I just got out of a midterm that I do not think I did too well on, and the spiral of worst case scenarios starts. A lot of it is due to the pressure of dental school, but a lot is also due to making my dad proud. He's done nothing to pressure me into doing well, but he's given me so much in regards to life and paying for college I feel so guilty if I don't get all As. My problem is mainly my mindset. I'm not ready to have the same semester I had last time, and I'm scared of who I'll upset for being like this. I thought I was better, but every time I have a midterm (usually math based) I break. I'm not going to get into dental school like this.",1

"Just attended my first theatre performance in a year!!! I can't get over how surreal it felt to actually attend a theatre performance, especially since I used to frequent art performances (theatre, opera, ballet, concerts) before the pandemic. I missed it so much and it was so nice to get to feel this high! The pre-performance gathering, drinks, walking up to the hall, getting your ticket checked, settling in your seat and then the dimming of the lights...... The applause at the end really hit home how important culture is and the emotion it brings. I can't imagine how elated the actors felt after such a long period of inactivity and finally an appreciative audience to thank them for all their hard work. It was strictly regulated, with only people with certificates (recovery or vaccine) allowed, plus they checked ID's to make sure the certificate was assigned to this person. Kudos to them for being careful while providing their services!",0
"Need to Vent I just need to vent. I’m sitting in the bath right now crying more than I have in a long time because I’m finally letting it all out. My Mom and Dad have always been people with their heads on straight but are now addicted to gambling. (It used to be just my Mom, using it as a filler of the void of losing her brother and mom so close together, but now my Dad goes as well) I just got a cat and it wouldn’t be an issue but since my Mom and Dad have gone out every night this week their schnauzer either comes in my room and terrorizes my cat around the clock or I lock her out of my room and she scratches and howls all night, leaving me with no sleep either way. I am too stressed to come home & too stressed to leave because I feel like I am abandoning my family. My mom has bad spine problems and has to spend most of the day on ice. This has led her to starting medical marijuana and isolating herself. She is also very christian, as well am I, but she constantly complains & sulks in her sorrow wondering why God won’t heal her and heals other people, but continues to do things that are bad for her health, like spend all hours of the night (I’m talking 10pm-6am) in the casino, and sleeping until 1pm everyday. My Dad is older (70s) and I am so afraid of moving/feel guilty not spending a lot of my time with him because I am afraid of him dying as he had prostate cancer a couple of years ago (it’s completely gone now, but still the fear is there.) I literally can’t take this emotional shit on top of school, work, my own emotional shit (anxiety, depression, OCD, still in pain over a bad breakup/loss of my best friend who I confided everything in a year ago) and trying to make something of my life. I want to succeed in music and acting and other things and I feel like I am just trapped. Guys I literally am just at my wits end right now. I just needed to vent. 21/F. Say a prayer or send good vibes or whatever you do, please. Thanks in advance.",1
"Ear stress while gaming. Lately I have noticed a grinding or vibrating sensation in or around my ears, most specifically and recognizably while playing and listening to the music in video games. The sensation is non-existent, or, at the most, significantly fainter, when doing other similar activities like listening to non-video game music, watching TV, or listening to podcasts or the radio. I am under a lot of stress and think it’s probably stress related, but it really does seem specific to video games. I suspect it might be something to do with game music, such as that in dragon quest 11 or Pokémon, tending to be higher pitched and “busier” than the sounds of those other things I mentioned. Anyway, thank you for reading, and I am wondering if anyone has experienced something similar, or has any thought about why this might be happening.",1
"I hate my mom my mom is a terrible person. she never respects anything I say, she complains about her colleagues at work all the time, saying they are shit people, but she's selfish, self obsessed and doesn't care for anyone else. today, she asked for my opinion on some thing at her work. i gave her my opinion, but because it wasn't the same as her opinion, she got angry and said I was talking shit. I tried explaining my opinion, but she just got angry and shouted that opinion was wrong over and over again. I got angry, and we had an argument. I told her she never respected anything I said, and she said I always have a bad attitude when I talk, which is a complete lie, i rarely get angry. she continued saying I was stupid, that nothing I was saying made sense, until I finally got fed up. I went to my room, and locked the door. I'm currently crying for the first time in 3 years. I have no friends, so there's no one to help me. i just wish I could have a better mom.",1
"Have you ever considered what makes us happy? What chemicals are released when you feel happy? Which habits can make us feel happy? Our happiness depends on many things. Your state changes depending on how you react to changes in your career, marriage, personal life and finances. There are several chemicals which makes you feel happy and these chemicals are Dopamine and serotonin. Your body releases dopamine as part of the reward system and Serotonin is more free-flowing when you feel important or valued by those around you. When you’re experiencing serotonin happiness, it takes no effort to feel joyful. No one feels happy 100% of the time, but the science of what causes happiness shows us that there are things we can do to boost our mood like exercising, eating your favorite meal, doing things you love, etc. [ Watch this video to know more",0
"Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life. Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener. I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated. My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests. I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.” Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me. I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings. I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best. I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences. I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset. I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy. My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me. I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak. Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react. I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too. TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at... Edit Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me I know it’s hard and I know it’s lonely trying to do good while being profoundly depressed with people and their actions. Well get through it",1

"I drew a comic about my experience with depression. Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period. I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

"Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic. I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties.",1

"my ""girlfriend"" has racist parents sorry if this whole this is all over the place) So am a senior, 16 years old and i have this girl that i am madly in love with and she is crazy in love with me aswell. I met her a year ago and for me it was basically love at first sight, the first week we knew each other we would stay up and facetime all night till we fell asleep and i don't even like facetime to begin with but i just couldn't get enough of her. I found out probably a week or 2 after i first started liking her that her parents (and the whole family) don't allow their children to date POC but i just didn't care because i was so in love with her and wanted her to be with me so i kept pursuing her and eventually got her to fall in love with me. We were just friends with benefits (just kissing and cuddling) and kept it a secret from our friends at first but eventually ended up telling them but when we go out in public or where there's people she wont even hold my hand or even hug me (I'm a huge physical touch person) if people could see it happening and i know she was paranoid of her parents finding out but i just feel like she is embarrassed to be seen with me in a bf/gf type of way. Like we were at an amusement park an hour and a half away from our house and i rarely even could get a hug from her or hold her hand without her walking ahead. She isn't allowed over to my house anymore, maybe because she get home late by just a few mins every time but the only time i can see her and be able to hug her or anything is when our friend group hangs out because she's too scared (or embarrassed i think) to hug in at school where people can see. It just sucks that the person im in love with and is in love back with me i cant even see whenever. She has tried twice telling her parents that she likes me which they didnt allow because i am black, but everytime she gets in trouble for it and almost got her car and phone taken aswell just because of that. They are obsessed with our friend who is part hispanic but they dont care about the fact that hes part hispanic because he is mainly white. I just feel like shit because i have to be judged for my skin color which is something that i cant even choose, but that automatically makes me a bad person to them. I had a good first impression on her parents, i had even offered to help them clean up when she had us over. But obviously that did nothing, but i just dont know what im supposed to do because she wants me to wait until she is 18 because she thinks that she can convince her parents that dating a black person isnt wrong, but what doesnt make sense to me is why they would allow it in a few months rather than just now and everytime i ask her how she will change them she doesnt give me an answer she just tells me to wait until she turns 18. And i dont know if i should or not because my other friend who has similar parents said that they wouldnt hang pictures of their grandkids up just because they were mixed. I dont want my children to have to be judged like that, i wish this upon no one, the way you can be with someone you love because of your skin color. Its a horrible feeling. I just want to talk to her parents and try and convince them that there would be nothing wrong with being with me but she wont let me talk to them and ive been trying to for almost a year now. I just dont know what im supposed to do, i dont know if i should wait or not because im not convinced at all that she can change her parents and she wont give me a way that she can so i have no reason to believe in her, i want to but i cant when she has nothing. I started hating the fact that i was born this way for a while but got over this, i just think about how different things could have been if i were just born white. Everything would be so much easier. I just need advice on whether or not i should stay with her or not, we arent dating but we are just friends with benefits i guess. It just sucks, please help me i dont know whether its worth the risk of waiting around for something that seems like 0% change of working or just trying to get over her and see if someone else has interest in me that doesnt have racist parents. Sorry for how long this is but thank you to everyone that helps.",1
"I can’t stop clenching my jaw!! Hello, Bear with me as this is my first post. I have suffered from stress for the past few weeks. I have had a lot of different symptoms but the jaw clenching is the worst! I have tried pain killers, anti-inflammatories, and massaging my jaw but nothing seems to help for more than a couple of minutes. I don’t seem to do it in my sleep - only during the day. And I feel relaxed when it happens so can’t seem to understand why I’m doing it. If anybody has any advice that would be great, thank you smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes ",1

"Paying close attention to your morning coffee can help you start your day with happiness We’re told that if we want to be happy, we need to exist in the present moment - but what does that actually mean? One helpful way to think about it is living through your senses - what you can perceive right now. As humans we have many senses (a lot more than five!) and we can use these to pull us back from worries about the future and regrets from the past. Take drinking a cup of tea or coffee as an example. We can - Listen to the kettle boiling - Look at the colour if the drink and the mug that its in - you’ve probably seen it 1000 times but you can look at it with beginners mind as if you’ve never seen it before - Feeling the warmth of the cup in your hands - Smelling the tea before you drink it - Noticing the taste / flavour - Feeling it pass down our throat There are many more perceptions for us to focus on. By tuning in to these we ground ourselves in the present moment, we calm ourselves and we can draw happiness from our everyday lives. Applying this awareness to your morning tea or coffee is an easy way to start to integrate awareness of the here and now into your life.

"I dont know if I can hold on much longer Ive been struggling for so many years now and it was always hard. And I always had bad thoughts. Ive never gotten a therapist, always somehow managed on my own. Ive been trying really hard to get help and I have to wait at least until January. But I dont know if I can do it that long anymore ) Its really hard, the thoughts are overwhelming, Ive never hurt myself this much ever before and several therapists have told me now, that I should go to inpatient (which I cant do atm) and try medication. I didnt know I was that bad. I dont feel that bad. But at the same time I feel worse than ever before. Im scared.",1
"Why does stress instantly show on my face? When I’m stressed I notice my face looks so bad, mainly wrinkled and fatigued. It also feels tense. Why is this?",1
Why the fuck does being alive always have to feel like an uphill battle. I can't fucking ever keep up. I'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. To anyone or anything. I can't keep up with life I'm so fucking tired of it. Why do I always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. I feel like i was damned upon conception. I was fucked from the start. With my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions I was FUCKED FROM THE START. I never stood a chance here. Why the living fuck do I always feel like I'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. Sometimes I want to end my life so badly but I am too afraid to hurt my family. I keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that I am hopeless. I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.,1

"I know someone ain't gonna read this, but anyways. Here's some nonsense wrote by a 19 years old child. I don't want to think about my future. It's dark. Why ? Because I'm not sure about my future plans. What if they doesn't work ? I can speak and write in English (I'm Turkish Btw). A little bit. Sometimes foreign customers come to the grocery store that I work. They've surprised to hear an average cashier talking in English, sometimes I make small conversations with foreigners. Some local customers even congratulate me because of my English speaking capability. I want to use this talent at a job. Translator would be a good option. But can I do it ? I don't know. What if I fail ? If I can't be a translator what can I do ? Being in tech industry. For example ; a game designer, software engineer, programmer, information technology, web designer etc... Perhaps I've got a talent for designing a web site. I graduated from web design division of my high school. Maybe I can make an income from this. Who knows ? What happens if this doesn't work ? I've got one more option. Being a photographer or a cameraman. I've had an enthusiasm about photography a year ago. This wouldn't be a bad idea. Being a photographer or a cameraman. What if this doesn't work ? Well, I'm out of options. The only way to get out is death. I'll commit suicide if I don't have a job and career in the future. Let's imagine for a minute. Me, a 30 years old grown ass man, unemployed, his mom and dad were died, his brother and sister left him alone. He's about to go insane. His past haunted him, with failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, bad decisions. He cry every time. He wanna go back to his childhood but he can't. He can't sleep, he can't eat, he just want to be dead. He picks up a gun. Shove it to his mouth, pulled the trigger, and bang ! He's gone. Will he rest in peace ? I don't think so. Because nobody knew about him. As if he wasn't lived. He's just an another fuel for the soil. He'll be vanished. I don't want to be like that. What the fuck I will do ? I DONT FUCKING KNOW !!! I gotta make a roadmap. But I can't. I FUCKING CAN'T. Because some cunt will be a manager or boss in a goddamn job with his father's help. In spite I worked like a slave. Road has some traps that I can't dismiss. May god help me and others. I lost my hope. There's no hope.",1

I'm a disappointment to everyone, and all I do I hurt the people who love me simply by existing because I'm such a failure. I wake up in the morning and already feel defeated.

"A lot of things all at once I seek this group because I don't feel I can't be this open to anyone else. If you see my life from outside, it looks like I am in a good point if my life. I'm on my last year of my PhD doing my research on a prestigious research center, it seems that I may have some job offers already, and I have make friends living in a beautiful and safe European country in comparison to my originary latin American country that is very dangerous and infested with COVID. Apparently I have done a good job in the lab where I'm doing my research because oftenly I receive praise from my superiors and other collaborators. I have many reasons to be grateful, and I am. I'm really am. However I fell like shit. This year took a toll on me, my dad died on may, and I couldn't travel to the funeral do to traveling restrictions. By that time I was recovering from some serious issues with my girlfriend and even do we sort it out, it was very stressful and difficult for me. I'm happy with my job, however I had to do a lot of sacrifices to be where I am now. I have faced a lot of chritique when I came here leaving my family and my girlfriend. But I have endure it.I have done my best to help other people to come here so they don't face the same problems that I had in the moment. But I feel that slowly this has become my unofficial responsability to the point that when I put limits because I need to focus on my projects or myself, my superiors get angry and keep pressuring me until I help my colleagues. If someone do a mistake, is not a big problem because they are new and they are learning. If I do a mistake I should pay more attention or dedicate more time because I'm have been the longest in the lab. To add salt to the wound I'm not the best administrator and I have terrible notion of dates and time, so I screw it up and I have to pay some fines for delay payments that even do are not impossible to pay, It kind of screw some wedding plans we have with my girlfriend delaying it. Even do she is very understanding. One of the chritique from some ""friends"" and family in my country is that I didn't married her before coming to study and actually that lead to the previous problem I mentioned. So this delay don't help with my newly discover anxiety. I have seen how all of this have slowly take me down one step at a time. It's 4 40 am and I cannot sleep, I wake up suddenly, I literally sleep all weekends. It has become incredibly difficult to clean my two room apartment. Or throw away a bag of trash, or wash my dishes, or take a shower. I know is getting worse but somehow everytime I decide to seek for help, I think, probably I'm exaggerating (sequels of my latin American mentality). I also have trouble to tell this to my friends because I don't want them to worry and I love them but they are the worse giving advice. When I was a kid, I used to cry until falling sleep when I face this kind of feelings, but I can't, I really wish I can. I just want to cry and free myself. But I have try a lot of things without success. At least writing this gave me some relief, I want to thank you for this group. And I'm sorry for my bad english and the long post.",1
Question Do you ever get a random thought about not being depressed for a while and are suddenly depressed?,1
"Never been so stressed in my life. I'm usually really good at handling stress. I brush shit off for my own sanity, perhaps sometimes a little too much. This time, however, is different. My wife and I are self employed and we are planning on buying a house for the first time in a few weeks. I'm incredibly stressed because it's very difficult to get pre-approved when you're self employed, especially in my situation. The long and short of it is I need to get pre-approved and buy this house for the sake of my finances, otherwise I might end up broke in some shithole apartment in the next few months until next year. My wife handles financial stress very poorly. As a result, she mostly asks to stay out of the loop on finances. I don't have a lot of people to talk about it with. Right now I'm taking a hard look at everything, and as a grown ass man I'm about to break down and cry from how stressful this all is. God help me.",1
I’m feeling bad physically and mentally. I guess not being able to board my plane took a toll on my health . Covid is a disaster.,1
"Anyone else they live in a family that acutely stresses them out daily? With the exception of my father, my family are good people, but still stress me out. We're all adults and I'm the youngest of them. Some examples, but not limited to Older brother jumps into conversations and often says something that irritates me (a snarky comment or tone), can be pushy Mother is often sarcastic (in a bad way) if I don't understand something, often throws assumptions ""Oh I guess you just don't care about X"" can also be pushy Father, the worst stresser and worst person I've ever known. Impatient, very pushy, disrespectful, violent towards family and animals, easily irritated, unpredictable. Honestly, his presence just puts a lot of weight on my shoulders because I feel like I have to take his shit, otherwise he will take his anger on someone else if I walk away which will just make things much worse such as a fight. So I often have to have a different persona around him. I think the only exception is my sister. It seems she's more simple and calm when compared to the rest of the 3. Even at times where I'm suppose to relax, I can't 100% just temporarily forget my worries. It's hard to find a place to be alone both at home and outside. Even under a tree, I'm afraid something will happen at home and I won't be there to stop it, or I'll receive a terrible phone call. Mostly because of my father escelating situations. Add those things along with worrying about health problems such as my hearing and tinnitus. I look forward to the day where I am in complete control of my life. If I ever have a family, it will only happen if I know for sure that I know me and my wife will be good to each other and others. Otherwise, I look forward to the day where I'm free of my current, uncontrollable stresses. Where I can wake up one morning, feed the animals, and relax outside. A time in my life where I can control on solving my stressors. Oh well. It could be a lot worse, but it could be better in the future.",1

"How to get out of the loop of self-hate I really did not realize I had this problem until about 6 months ago. I do not like myself. I do not see myself as worthy of anyone's attention. I have always had lots of friends and surrounded by people as much as I want to be, but I cannot shake this voice in my head. If people invite me out I tell myself its because they want me to drive, they want to crash at my place after, they want to use my pool. They do nothing to give me this feeling yet my mind tries to convince me. I am 24 and never been in a relationship. Every time a girl has shown interest in me, I turn them away. They sleepover and I don't make a move, then they ask why I didn't and I do not have an answer. In my head of course I do not feel good enough to make a move, I fear rejection even though I know I wouldn't be rejected. I have turned down probably 10-15 girls in the past two years alone. It makes me feel dumb.. I sit here lonely yet reject everyone that comes my way. It is self-sabotage. How can I ever progress when this voice convinces me otherwise. I went to a club recently and had to leave. I looked around at everyone having a good time and happy and I was standing there feeling like an ogre in a mix with all king and queens. I just do not understand how people have confidence. I do not understand why I never had any. Can anyone relate with the voice in their head just convincing them to think negativity 100% of the time?",1

My life is ruined I recently turned 20 years old and I am having a hard time doing things. I can't even get a job no matter how hard I have been trying. I feel like a burden to my family and those around me. I'm a failure and a disappointment and I know it.,1
"I'm constantly an emotional mess. My life has been extremely tough. I was brought up by my mother who was suffering through schizophrenia. I was passed around my family as a baby and young child because mom couldn't always look after me. Never met my father. By the age of 21 my entire family had passed away from various illnesses leaving me alone in the world. I have suffered with extreme depression and suicidal thoughts all my life. I didn't have a normal upbringing nor a childhood. And I find interacting with people often challenging. I realise I am not normal. Not in the same league with people. And people often do things or say things that go right over my head and I make little sense of it. Or maybe I say things or do things they don't understand. Either way there is often communication failure and frustration. Needless to say I have had long term relationships. And this year my partner of 10 years decided to betray me. Unfortunately, his timing couldn't be worse with covid and the housing market being a mess I find myself trapped with him in a toxic and abusive environment. He has successfully talked each of our long term mutual friends into ceasing communication with me, behind my back and ostracized me from the group, so I now find myself totally alone and isolated without a single friend in the world to talk to. They all report back to him what I say to them and don't even answer me, instead he attacks me for talking to them. Furthermore, this all came to be because he fell in love with a straight guy who is a total loser drug addict. And he left me for THAT! without even having any idea if the guy felt the same way or any end game plans, just ended our relationship and started hanging out with these new druggy friends of his just to be near the guy... You have no idea how hurt I am. I've got nothing inside me anymore but sheer hate and bile and negativity, I am literally screaming like a wild beast inside my mind, I have enough. I don't deserve this. I have done everything I can for him these last 10 years! I wash, I cook, I clean, I love, I give great sex, We game together, We have mutual friends together, we go out places and he's seemed like he's been enjoying living with me and being with me and then out of the blue he rips my heart out and sets about utterly destroying my life. I have broken down in tears more than once this year and he's literally LAUGHED in my face. He ENJOYS hurting me. And I just can't even comprehend WHY. I mean I have done nothing to warrant this. I've never cheated on him, never had personal friends outside of the relationship. Never kept secrets from him. He has no motive to have done this. He recently had his 30th birthday, and he held a funeral for his youth that I wasn't invited to. He came home and flat out raged at me for wasting his 20s on me. They he had wasted 10 years of his life because of me... I just don't even....my mind is imploding. I cannot cope. I'm 40 now. And I feel like... I dunno.. like I'm just some dumb kid without a clue. I cannot stop crying. I'm shaking all the time with nerves and anxiety. I'm utterly terrified of him, I don't mean that he's going to hurt me physically, he wouldn't lay a finger on me I know that. But I'm scared of saying the wrong thing to trigger him by mistake. I'm walking on glass around him now all the time. He is volatile and just so full of irrational hate towards me. I'm beyond heartbroken. This has been going on all year now. I've attempted suicide already this year. And I have perfected a method that should work with inert gas. I have it all under my bed waiting to be used. The only thing stopping me is my own selfish survival instincts. I have tried mental health services, my GP and a referral to a primary care unit for multiple evaluations. They say I'm likely suffering from post traumatic stress, severe anxiety and depression. But nothing has changed for me, nothing has come of this. I am not even on anti depressants despite me repeatedly asking for them. I just feel ignored. Alone. Unwanted. Hated. Heartbroken. Abandoned. Destroyed. I break down crying at work. I just don't see a point. Don't see a future. Why am I even there? What am I working for? money? I just don't care anymore. All of my life goals and plans revolved around him. We live in private rental right now but we were saving for a deposit on buying our own house. I had big plans to do it up nice for us, he was my forever partner, I relied on him and I gave him all of myself in return. I was in love. I AM in love. I miss him so much. I don't know what to do anymore, I can't think how to fix this. I can't think how to escape this. I really really want to overcome the fear of death and get on with it. I want him to come home to find my dead body and for him to know he did this. He killed me. And I will never even know why. I hope this was worth it for him. I'm mere thoughts away from gassing myself. Please someone help me. Tell me what I should do and how can I do it? I don't want to die! but I don't want to live either. My life is nothing but pure pain.",1

"Recently graduated and I’m stressed losing hope Okay ever since this COVID-19 thing happened my stress and depression levels had jumped up like 1000% and still getting worse. I live in this huge family and everyone here does something that stresses me out every single day. My mom is barely home doing what ever she does and my dad doesn’t live here. I’m basically the one watching all the kids and it’s driving me insane. None of them listen and always disobey everything no matter what!

DAE have this 180 in thoughts? Does anyone else have issues with suicidal planning and intrusive thoughts one week and then the next week you feel fine? Like there could still be some depression there but you don’t wanna die anymore? This can even be like a day difference. You can go from wanting to attempt one night to not wanting to die the next? Is this a normal depression symptom? Thinking about asking my therapist about it.,1
"Struggling with work, being constantly overwhelmed Hi there. First post here. So i’ve had depression for about 7 years (diagnosed). I’m 22 now. For the past year my depression hasn’t been intensely bad (still there though obviously). Then I got this office job that was good to me at first but there were some issues as they overboard me with work and make me do things I’m not even qualified to do. It’s gotten really bad lately as i’m pretty much doing work that you need a Bachelors Degree for. I’m now struggling to complete things and im making mistakes all the time. My depression has been awful in turn of this as it leaves me feeling overwhelmed and like im stuck and it genuinely makes me feel like this is all my life is now. I know in previous experience that my depression really rips out any motivation/energy to be productive with anything including work. I’m naturally a really hard worker so i’m struggling really hard with this as I feel so down and out every day and it’s affecting other people at work and I know I just really want to leave. My point of this post though wasn’t to just rant about me, I was just wondering if anyone else with depression/depressive disorders goes through this with their work life and what was your experience like. Did it help a lot once you left? I’ve asked for help but my boss told me that this job is “sink or swim”. Im debating on going back on my antidepressants because of this and just need some guidance from people that have been through similar experiences. Please be kind here as I know my work struggles can come across as “lazy” and I hate it. Thank you",1

"Stress on left side of brain, feeling stressed all the time and struggling to find words to speak *No, it is not a tumour, I have had MRIs, EEGs etc.** So essentially, I struggle to find the words that I want to say. I often stutter, and repeat a few words like 2-3 times every now and then. This is over the last few years (currently 23). I find there are days where my head is completely clear, and I feel like my head is clear of all clutter and can find every word I want to say. Looking back on these days, I find that I have been surrounded by people I love and am comfortable with. Where I feel accepted. So I do not struggle to say things and can speak freely. The next day I tend to feel amazing and can speak freely as well. The following days, it reverts back to the same tension and struggle to find words. It would appear that it might be related to me not feeling accepted anywhere? Or not feeling confident? I am hoping someone has experienced this and knows of any exercises that can relieve this tension and allow me to think and speak freely. (I eat well, meditate, exercise, have a lovely family, lovely relationship, I do see a neurologist for other reasons and yes I am aware that this could be related but I want to explore simple stress techniques as well, so please please please if you can, just provided some exercises that may help) Thank you guys so much.",1
"I can't kill myself until my cat dies For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned. I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night. Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year. EDIT Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend. ",1
"I could use some encouragement/advice So, this is my first time posting, so a little backstory My Grandparents passed away in 2000-2001. All 4, 2 of whom helped raise me. My brother passed away in 2001. My Mom passed away in 2015 (while I was pregnant), so that was super hard. She was depressed and it was suicide. My Dad had bad health for 5 years leading up to his death. I managed his care weekly and when I went on a mission trip for two weeks (the only time I was ever unreachable about his care) he passed away within 2 days of me returning because no one listened to me before I left when I asked for him to be checked and treated for a UTI. I have another brother who has been missing for 2 years now. There is one more potential brother out there that my Dad fathered through an affair, but I can't find him and he wants nothing to do with my family. That family is just me now. Honestly, it feels brutal. Crushing. I should have a huge family, but I don't. It is just me. Although I have a wonderful husband and amazing 5 year old daughter I feel alone. A lot. I take my medication and it helps very much, but honestly, I feel hollow a lot of the time. I want parents and siblings and I feel so robbed of that. Not that my life isn't wonderful. It is. Something just feels missing and I feel so hollow. Does anyone ever feel this way? Like you should be happy because you have a great life. Descent job, great immediate family. But you aren't. You feel empty from your loss of family and knowing you're the only surviving family (all by 35)? My husband is an only child and I try to bond with his mother (his Dad has passed away too), but we are so different and she is judgmental. Their isn't much of a bond there. I have tried so many times. I get really upset when I hear friends complain about their family. Most times I just bite my tongue. Often times, I just can't get out of this rut. Like, I wish an adult family would adopt me so I don't feel so broken and can have a Mom to turn to again. Not that my family was amazing. They weren't. A lot of drug use and emotional abuse, but they are family, you know? My Mom got better in her old age as did my Dad, but my childhood was no cakewalk. Something that has taken a lot of therapy to move on from and forgive. What is your advice on dealing with this?",1

"Guidance needed I suffer from depression and anxiety due to traumatic experiences I had faced over the last few years. Sometimes they consume me to the point where I keep thinking and dreaming of my fears. I try to convince myself something bad isn't going to happen but I end up failing. Sometimes I'm sure it's my GUT feeling but then nothing really happens after. Yet, somehow, I am so sure. This kind of negativity that's coming from within me bogs me down. Does anyone know how I can overcome this or rather, help me find ways to get through this?",1

"Covid scare Hi, I’m an Indian citizen and as those who keep a tab on world news would know, we’re going through a devastating second wave in India at the moment. Our government is highly incompetent, and is led by people who led pogroms against minorities. Their lack of empathy is our there, where our people (not the the poorest ones but especially them) are dying without oxygen. Our government did not plan in one whole year, and now we have no vacant hospital beds, no ICU beds, no ventilators in the national capital and other states. Basics such as oxygen cylinders are a struggle to purchase, and thousands are dying each day, among which a lot of deaths are those that could’ve been avoided. People are asking for help on twitter and Instagram while there is no centralised helpline till now in world’s “largest democracy”. So, of course, all of this is highly stressful. One worries not just about their own selves and families, but such a devastating state of affairs takes a toll in a lot of ways. I can only understand in part what war torn countries go through. However, I do have the privilege of staying indoors (and help in whatever capacity I can through my social media). In addition to this, my lover moved countries right before this started happening, so that it also troubling at a personal level. I am writing here to seek help from all of you on how to cope with this.",1
"Anyone I’m getting better. I still have a ways to go. These past few days have been difficult. Extremely difficult. But I can’t give up my progress. I know that I should strive to be a better person because I want to be. But they’re times when I question my existence in the world,my value to the people I care about. I lost a good friend. One of the few real friends I have left. I try to reach out. Just for conversation. To hear a voice. Not even to talk about what I’m going through inside. Just to converse. And because I truly care for them. Not to put them down, they didn’t have time for me. It’s not them. They have friends and family that love them Because they are good people. They truly are! It’s me. I have a bad essence that surrounds me. It’s the way I was made. . And it’s been with me since birth. And I know this. I should know better. I enjoyed being there for the ones care about. And I will continue to better myself for them as well. For when they do reach out, I could be a sense of comfort to them. I know how it feels to have no one who genuinely cares whether I’m happy or sad. Other than my brother who passed away 11 years ago. It’s simply been this way Since I can remember. And I’m OK with it. I did it the first half of my life. I have to get back into that mindset. I refuse to backslide. My mind is my is my safe place. It kept me safe in the dark. It is not weak. I just needed some place to let this out.",1

"Overcoming housefire trauma There was a neighborhood housefire a few months ago in my area and our house was a few feet away from getting burned down. Ever since, I get hyper alert whenever someone shouts or raises his/her voice because I get reminded of that day. I also palpitate whenever I hear an ambulance or a firetruck. My main problem is, even if months have already passed, I’m still greatly stressed out by it. I always have thoughts that maybe a fire will happen again, especially at night, which will be worse. To add, after that neighborhood fire, there were two more minor fire incidents that happened nearby. Last night, I went to bed early. There was no trigger but all of a sudden, my thoughts were racing, “There might be a fire!!” kept on repeating in my head. A neighbor started coughing (the house is close to each other), and I began to palpitate and get scared as if I’m waiting for something, I really don’t know. How do I get over this? Or where do I start on addressing it? I hate feeling like this, even more so that I feel I’m the only one who got affected this much. I really hope someone will reply here, I really need the help. Thank you!",1
"Self Confidence and Self worth are not the same A lot of people seem genuinely surprised that I suffer from depression, because I like to joke around and I'm extremely confident in myself. What a lot of people don't get is I can be confident in my abilities while still feeling worthless. I'm very intelligent, athletic, and charming (despite my obvious cockiness lol). My problem isn't that I feel I lack those things, it's that I always feel like if I'm not the best I'm a failure. If it's for a job application, I'm sure I'm qualified but someone better qualified definitely applied, so why bother. I'm very muscular and reasonably good looking, but the girls I date are definitely used to dating sex gods, so I'm constantly fighting those shadows. When it comes to sports I know I'm decent, but I gotta be the best, so anything less than 1st hurts. Hell depending on the competition even 1st place feels empty. It sucks that people's go to advice is ""be confident in yourself"". For people lacking confidence, that's way underestimating the task. For people who are depressed but don't experience a lack of confidence, it's worthless advice.",1

"In 2009, I helped Hurricane Katrina victims. Hurricane Ida is hard for me. In 2009, I was a Chemical Engineering intern outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. I lived in Jefferson Parish and worked in Hahnville, Louisiana outside Bayou Boute. It was 4 years after Hurricane Katrina. Sisters of Charity Hospital, the hospital for the poor before Katrina, was still closed. On my weeknights, I volunteered at a makeshift medical clinic operating out of a church basement and staffed by medical students, residents, and interns from nearby Tulane University. I spent my weekends building homes for Habitat for Humanity in the 9th Ward, the neighborhood hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina. Many homes still had blue tarps where the roof blew off. Whole streets were still full of empty and destroyed homes. The neighborhood looked like pictures of bombed out neighborhoods I had seen in World War 2 documentaries. FEMA had spray painted these homes with the number of dead bodies found inside. Grass grew up through the street and sidewalk. Lawns were littered with ruined possessions and cars. The owners had either died or left and never returned. We did the best we could to help. We built houses on stilts higher than Katrina's storm surge. I looked into the faces of university-educated people like school teachers and accountants who had been made homeless overnight. It was heartbreaking. We promised these people that it was going to be ok. We gave them shelter. We told them the worst period of their life was behind them. My heart is breaking again due to Hurricane Ida. It is different when the faces on television were your neighbors, and people who touched your life. They changed me for the better. I am upset and disgusted that my former neighbors in New Orleans have had to face two devasting hurricanes in their lifetimes. I wish I could go down and help again, but I am not in a position to do so. My neighborhood in Jefferson Parish was one of the hardest hit with 10 to 15 feet of water in the street. An electrical transmission tower near my old apartment collapsed and fell into the Mississippi River. More than 1 million customers are without electricity. Hospitals have been damaged and are running on backup generators. Hurricane Ida made landfall too fast for the New Orleans to evacuate people who do not have cars. Doctors, nurses, first responders and the national guard in Louisiana and neighboring states are exhausted because Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, and Arkansas are dealing with a devasting 4th wave of COVID-19. The post-Katrina plan had been to evacuate hospital patients out of Louisiana to surrounding states, but COVID-19 meant that the hospitals in neighboring states were full of COVID-19 patients. After Katrina, first responders and national guard from neighboring states handled the majority of the rescues and emergency response, because Louisiana first responders and national guardsmen had been hurt, lost their homes, been killed, injured, or had family members killed or injured. Those resources are not available today. National guard units and first responders in neighboring states were already overburdened due to COVID-19. Our public safety infrastructure is close to breaking down.",1
"I'm thinking about giving up on my depressed girlfriend Please tell me it gets better someday.

When we are together we can cope. Almost. But when we can't see each other it's an avalanche of no sleep, arguments, and listening to how useless it is to continue( of course breaking up is not an option, even though she asks me to burn my photos of her once every week). I'm at the point where I rather sleep 12 hours a day and not leave my room because everything else failed. Just tell me some of you got through this, so I can wake up before 1 pm tomorrow.",1

I feel like I need to run away and call it quits My direct deposit has been coming in late lately and it’s not much due to only working a little bit because of the pandemic.

They can’t extend it and I can’t call the bank to see if they will reverse my overdraft fees due to the direct deposit.

I'm extremely shaken up, but I think she wouldn't want me to be sad for her.

"I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness. I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis. I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis. My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.” I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.

"I can’t stand my family and their dysfunction I have been suffering from the flu-like symptoms for half a decade now. From throat tightening, nasal drips, muscle soreness, cold, and general depression and now that I’m stuck inside the house with my family. I can’t help but feel helpless. My dad blows a fuse for the smallest things, completely negative & judgmental over everyone. That’s why we don’t have family or visitors come over the house. No one likes him for his personality. Ge’s just far better off that’s why people kiss his ass. What I hate the most is that they don’t have a sense of boundaries. Not being able to have “control” and say about my personal items when he gets unreasonable really upsets me. For example he fucking threw my plants away because he saw news about an increase of dengue cases. Can’t I have anything that’s mine? He’s needy and requires special treatment from everyone. It’s such a drain to be around his negativity and his overall personality. He takes food from my plate even there is literally whole untouched piece right in front of him. He took my food that I paid for without permission even though we’re not in speaking terms. It’s not that I’m tight wad and selfish but the fact that he gets to take my stuff and do as he pleases is the problem. What’s worse is that this learned behavior is exactly what my asshole of a brother does as well. I get anxious just being near or around him. Yesterday I hit my head bad and it started to bleed as I hurried and went into a frantic pace trying to leave the kitchen as soon as he opened his mouth and started talking to me about how to live my fucking life. We’re not even in speaking terms. My mom even left the country to get away from this asshole. They’re not divorced or anything but she’s “making a sacrifice for us to get Japanese citizenship” & started investing there.

"I'm homeless now Because I ran away from abusive parents. Never thought I'd actually do it but here I am. I don't want to return. There it's pure hell. It's agonizing to live there. Now I am outside and I will live on the streets. My number one fear became alive. It's incredible how fears and the thing you don't want most to happen actually happen. Life is hell. Life is torture. I don't know what the fuck i will do from now on. Guess I'll be what I feared to be the most. That's it. EDIT I took the decision on impulse and I realized that it's impossible to do this on this time of the year. I'm too weak so I gave up. I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester. Unfortunately, the country I live in is shit and has little to no possibilities for those in disadvantaged situations. Abuse is considered normal here. Thank you everyone for the support and advices, it means a lot to me. EDIT 2 I'm from Romania.",1

"Anyone keep switching from admitting to yourself that you have depression to invalidating yourself into thinking you were just playing victim? I know I have issues. But I go through manic mood swings, and while on the depressive end I feel like absolute shit, when I'm out of that phase and feel somewhat ""normal"" again I tell myself I greatly exaggerated the effect in my mind. It doesn't help that my self loathing won't let me admit that I have depression because I keep thinking I don't deserve to be depressed. So I invalidate myself and continue life until the next phase hits, and the cycle continues.",1
"Staying stressed I'm so stressed more than normal. I'm still in the grieving process since July 2019 when my papaw died. He was like my dad. Now fast fwd to now my grandma is selling her house because her dr stated she doesn't need to be living by herself. I can't live with her because i have my own family and my apt is not big enough for her and she wouldn't be able to handle my kids all the time. Plus she's starting to get frail (my grandma is super strong and looks 20 years younger than her age of 75). So she's going to live with my aunt in Iowa and she's all i got. My sister barely talks to me because of other choices and my medical condition (Epilepsy) so I don't get to see my niece and nephew very often. I don't speak to my mother, stepfather if you want to call him that and my brother for other personal reasons. So i feel like i'm being left alone even though i have my 3 kids and fiancée. I see her everyday and talk to her everyday my kids get dropped off there after school and we go see her. I feel like i'm just losing her like i did papaw and then when she passes I'm going to lose her again. I'm extremely sad. Yes I'm depressive and on medication but medication can't help block all emotions that are happening in short periods of time. I can't talk to a therapist face to face because they won't be back in the office till July and I can't talk to them through zoom or on the phone because I need someone there to call me out when I try to hold things back. Plus before this I constantly stay stressed and my anxiety meds just put me to sleep. I don't want to be this stressed out all the time. Just needed to talk.",1
"I ruined my friendship with my bestfriend and I dont want to live anymore First of all, Im sorry if this is wrong subreddit to talk about. If it is, I will delete it. Im not sure where else to put this. Few months ago I started to have unusual anxieties out of blue. I dont get usually anxieties but I did. It started at night and I remember that it was specifically about me dying soon. Later on it'd be different things and soon I would have constantly anxieties, during days or me just doing whatever. Later on I would focus too much on little details, the way my pfp is, the way people talk to me and etc. But I focused a lot on how my bff behaved and talked to me. She is really important person in my life, like I have been friends with her since 2015 or 2016. She is everything to me. So I started to get anxious and think that she is ignoring me now, talking less to me for whatever reason or liking me less. We had lots of fight because of that. She was dealing with problems too but I will not talk about them, its not my place anyway. It got to the point where we fought nearly everyday. It even got to the point where I guilt tripped her. Not on purpose of course. When she told me that, I was freaking out badly. I wanted to kill myself even before we fought. Was driving me nuts and there was a moment when I planned when to kill myself. I cant swim and Im afraid of pain. There was a bridge not far away from where I lived. I had a specific day, like I think it was on Saturday night. Not many cars drive or people walk at night so it was perfect time for me jump off the bridge. Eventually I told her my plan and she begged me not to do it. Which I didnt. When she told me for the first time that I guilt tripped her, I felt shit, it was that day when I left the server and thought I could finally end myself. I hurt a person that meant so much to me. And now I have hurt her. The only person that I was supposed to help and be there for her. I couldnt kill myself. All I did was just stand on the bridge and stare at the ocean. So I left the place back to my own place. And decided to fix myself. Unfortunately Im a piece of shit and didnt fix anything. We fought again. And a lot. I guilt tripped her more. At one point I thought I fell in love her and maybe thats how I have been. I was extremely jealous of one guy talking to her so I really hated him and I started to hate everything that was related to her bf. I learned that I wasnt in love with her but I was being extremely selfish. I wanted to be her only reason for her to be happy and not other people. I wanted to be her number one no matter what because thats how I viewed her. But eventually things did get better to some extent. We did fight less or maybe even not that much. But it became more of her being afraid of telling me just not to start another fight. But I was getting better and I didnt go apeshit over her mentioning her bf, I was quite fine about it. Things to me seemed better. Getting less anxious. We even called this Monday. We had fun. We didnt fight this week at all. But now, today, she told me she doesnt want to be my bestfriend. It didnt help that I was having a mental breakdown before she told me that. I would never think I would hear that. We have been friends for so long. We went through stuff together. I have been there for her and she has been there for me. She never had an easy life and I have been there for her for everything that was possible. I loved her so much. I cant believe this happened at all. I dont have a meaning anymore. She was everything to me, the only bestfriend that I could count on. I never told my feelings to anyone than her. But now that she doesnt want to be my bestfriend, I have lost everything. It may sound very stupid for you guys but I mean it when I say that she was everything for me. She brought me happiness just by messaging me. She doesnt think in the future things will be the same, or that we will be bestfriends again. I have ruined everything. I hurt the only peron who I deeply cared. I hurt them to the point where they are afraid of me at times. I was always afraid of being alone but had high hopes because she was with me. I thought that was going to last no matter what. I wasnt myself this summer, I put my anger onto her and this is my consequence. Now I dont have anybody in my life. I feared to be alone and now I am alone. No one. I dont care what happens to me anymore. Im fine if I go blind by this point. I am having big eye issues and that made my anxiety go apeshit. My anxiety isnt the reason why I acted like this. I should have controlled myself better and not hurt her. But I was a dumb shit, Im still a dumb shit. Now Im no one, no one to have. Im all alone and I deserve all the pain Im having. I dont care who I am anymore. I really dont care if Im alive anymore. The pain is too big now. I dont think I can handle it now. I made plans for next week to end myself.",1
"My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure. However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist."" This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express? *LIL' UPDATE* Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone! I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion. With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay.",1

It happened a few times the first day and its just progressively gotten worse. Working on final projects and getting really frustrated would cause me tic attacks. I honestly don't know how to deal with this, I've been trying to convince myself I've somehow made it all up and im doing it on purpose??? Has anybody else dealt with this before and or does anyone have some tips to help stop it? It's been really distracting and frustrating to deal with at work.

"Sometimes the people around you don't care about you, fuck them. I want to be honest with all of you, people don't care about your well being. It's a hard pill to swallow but that's the truth. I remember being in the darkest days of my life dreading every living moment. Never going out, eating, and rarely even slept. My mind telling me noone cares about me or wanting someone to reach out to see if I was ok. Sadly it doesn't work the way you think. People are always busy in their own problems and thoughts so you never come up in their mind. I was suicidal for weeks wanting to end my life until I realized that I don't need self validation or love from other people. That doesn't mean you should be cold hearted and give the finger to everyone you meet. Just live your life the way you want it, don't worry about the people that don't give a shit about you. Focus on your well being before anyone else. TLDR Not everyone around you gives a fuck about you so fuck them.",1
"I'm obsessed with him and it's making me sick.. 23 female.. There's this person (Mark Davis) 47, M. I've been fixated on since around 2015. It's like when I saw him, there was this INSTANT interest/bond. Ever since, it's like I HAVE to learn everything about him, even the most minute detail like his favorite color, what his medical history is, details about his job (Prison Warden) his political views, birthday (December 25th) everything, and they're quite similar to mine. When I found out what his full name was, I was literally giddy and in a daze for a couple days. Just seeing the videos he's made makes me happy, I can be really stressed out or just feeling depressed, or anxious. But then he makes me feel better. He's super dorky but I find that adorable, he has this kind of charming energy and a voice that I find soothing. (He sounds exactly like Jello Biafra) I haven't met him in person yet, but I hope to eventually. He isn't exactly a friendly person all of the time, he can be an asshole to people at times. I remember impulsively going full-hate mode on him when he said that he hated children. Then I snapped out of it..But I'm still attached to him and sometimes he even finds his way into my dreams then I get upset because it seems real. He comes into my mind several times a day, like during dinner time I think, hmm I wonder what he's eating for dinner, or wondering when he's got home from work, when he'll be sleeping and then imagining him nice and comfy in bed. I wonder how he's doing right now. I've had these horrible nightmares where I'll dream that he died and I'd wake up literally sobbing, if he died I can't imagine how depressed I'd feel. It makes me feel physically sick to imagine anything happening to him. I had this dream where he was found dead in a pit of spikes and there was blood everywhere and his eyes and mouth were wide open. Then I felt him and he was freezing cold.. It messed me up for days I keep feeling nauseous whenever I think about him like I've been on a rollercoaster or something. Problem is...I have no way of directly contacting him and I'm not even sure if he'd want me as a friend or not. I don't know what to do and I don't feel like I want to discuss this with a doctor in person, because I'd seem crazy and stalker-ish.",0

"My best friend is severely depressed and quit her meds cold turkey and isn’t acting like herself *TW* I don’t know how to help her. We have been best friends for YEARS. We even loved together as roommates for quite a few. She has struggled with depression basically her whole life. I have always been a support system for her. And I thought I had seen her bad episodes (I knew her when she almost made an attempt) but I have never seen anything like this. Unfortunately we don’t live together any more but I try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed. She is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which I appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but I don’t know what to. She has been suicidal the past three months, isolating her self from friends and family (only talking to me because I make her and that was hard to do) she hasn’t been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result, she has no regard for future consequences (she was fine with the potential of going to jail) she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive (it’s not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but I believe they may be codependent). She stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week. She was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year. Not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor. When she was really down I sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she can’t afford to be hospitalized. I told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they can’t hospitalize you but she didn’t want to hear it. I don’t know what do. In the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted I was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while. But now she is isolating herself from even her therapist. I am absolutely terrified that I am going to get a call that I was too late and that she is gone. Is there anything I can do?",1
"How do I stop overthinking? Overthinking has been a problem of mine for a long time, I have restless nights since I can remember. I don't have any problems with the Past or Letting go, as for letting go somehow was always easy for me, but I constantly overthink every little detail of my life and everything that COULD happen and I can never really live in the moment. My thoughts affect my emotions, and my emotions affect my thoughts, its like a never ending vicious circle. I also noticed that my overthinking starts to affect my relationship negatively. Sidenote I tried LSD not too long ago, because I heard about experiences that helped people with overthinking and/or depression, and for me, LSD worked wonders, for about the next 3 weeks, I really enjoyed life and I was living in the moment, It felt like someone tidied up my thoughts, everything became clear. My thoughts didn't stop 100%, but the little overthinking that I had left seemed so irrational that I could just dismiss it. As beautiful as it was, I don't want to revoke to taking LSD every time my overthinking begins. I always thought overthinking is something that will always stick with me and there is nothing I can to about it, but since I tried LSD and stopped overthinking for a while, I noticed how beautiful life can be as long as my thoughts don't disrupt me from enjoying life to the fullest, and now I really want to achieve that mindset again.",1

"talk to someone about your problems"" they said, ""it'll help"" they said I told my mom about my problems. Thankfully she was very accepting, but that's about the only good thing that came of it. She didn't understand how bad it's gotten, she doesn't understand that i want to be alone, she doesn't understand that i need more help than just ""I'm here for you"". It's really hard for me to talk about this to my parents, so i can't tell them that i feel like i need professional help. Now it's also really awkward for me to talk to them, since it's very obvious that they're ""subtly"" trying to support me. I appreciate the effort, but i wish they just acted like they did before. I can't stop thinking about the fact that i might have just ruined everything. There's also something that bothers me about my parents knowing. I'm fine with my closest friend knowing, but I can't shake the feeling that it was a big mistake to tell my parents",1

"I've given up Since childhood I've never felt truly happy. I thought I found it once and I ruined it. It destroyed me and I let myself slip into darkness. I was numb. Uncaring and selfish. I turned to drugs to cope. I didn't want to die but I didn't want to live. I was stuck in an emotionless twilight. At the time I didn't mind it because I didn't hurt anymore. A few years back I got a new job and met someone there that I instantly fell in love with. It scared me. I tried to keep my keep my distance. I knew I would ruin it eventually. I thought it best to not drag anyone down with me. That was easier said than done. The more we talked the more I realized she understands the type of pain I'm going through. I let myself care about her. We finally expressed how we feel about each other and began dating. We both had our problems and knew what we were getting in to, at least I thought so. I struggled to overcome my addiction and learn to love again. I was honestly a really shitty partner in the beginning. I didn't communicate well. I was absent and distant. She stuck it through with me and I became a much better person. I owe it all to her. She was an alcoholic and when covid began she quit her retail job and spiraled out of control. It was a struggle. I worked 10-12 hour days 6 days a week. I would come home to her blacked out almost daily. I stuck with it. Doing whatever I could to help her overcome. She ended up in the hospital a few times and eventually tried an outpatient treatment program. It didn't help. After reaching out to her mother for advice she suggested inpatient. I was desperate to help her so I agreed. I didn't want her to be locked away like that but I didn't know what else to do. I'd tried everything up that point. Her mom gave her an ultimatum; go to inpatient willing, or have it court ordered. She went on her own. It didn't help. She came back even worse. Disturbed by all the horrifying stories she had to listen to while in there from other addicts. She resented me for colluding with her mom. One day I come home from work and she wasn't home. That immediately struck me as odd and I tried to call and text her to no reply. Her phone was turned off. There was no note. Her things and car were still there but she had disappeared. I began searching her known hangout spots around a nearby river. Nothing. I was getting scared. I called her mom and she hadn't heard from her. We called the police and filed a missing person's report. They pinged her phone and it's last location was miles away. Sheriff's checked it out and nothing. The next day her mom tells me she heard from her. I was so happy to know she was alright. Then she told me she was with her abusive ex. I felt my heart shatter. Even still I tried to get a hold of her to understand what happened. She regretted her decision and explained she acted on a drunken impulse. She wanted to come home. I was upset but I understood addiction can make you do terrible things. I forgave her and went to get her. A couple weeks later she did it again. I was angry. Despite that I reached out to her to make sure she was alright. I wanted to know if this is what she truly wanted and if not I was willing to bring her home again. She eventually asked me to come get her. Once we got home I explained that this is going to take time to heal from. I still want us to be together but I'm very hurt. She apologized and eventually I was able to forgive her. Lately she's been so angry and resentful towards me for my behavior in the beginning of our relationship. She keeps bringing up past mistakes. Things we've already talked about. Things I've accepted responsibility for and sincerely apologized. It doesn't seem to matter. It's like she hates me now. She expects her past to be accepted, forgiven, and forgotten. My mistakes, however, are continuous sources of anger for her and they can never be forgiven. I opened up to her recently and told her that I'm not well. I tried to explain that I have been planning on ending my life soon. She didn't listen and started getting upset about my past again. It's like she wants me to do it. I told her that this isn't just a plea for attention or to feel sorry for me. That I'm serious and I'm making one last attempt to get help. She blew me off and began interrogating me about something in my past. At this point my heart has grown cold. I'm numb again. I don't feel that I deserve to be happy. That I'm incapable of being loved. I think it's time to follow through. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. One last selfish act. The last time I'll ever hurt anyone ever again.",1

"I need your opinion please. So my severely depressed ex boyfriend broke up with me some days ago. He was distancing for two months now. I tried everything I could but it reached its peek and he told me he needs to let me move on, he will not get better and I deserve someone who can give me the world. It was all really respectful and caring. On the one hand he tells me he needs someone he can see and have things in common on the other hand he says he doesn’t need anybody or anyone anymore. He just wants to be alone completely. He barely even talks to family but he says they know what his problems are and it’s his fight. He says he doesn’t feel anything anymore, he doesn’t know who or what he is, it’s like he lost himself. He said the guy I knew and fell in love with is gone and dead and he had to get rid of him to get stronger and better. (Does anyone know why or what could have happened?) All got really bad two weeks ago when something happened related to his dad who died surprisingly without anyone knowing, he couldn’t say goodbye and he was his best friend. From then on he only wanted to be alone and I let him. But now he broke up and said we will never be together and it’s not our choice to make. He is also suicidal, can’t talk about what’s going on and also has ADHD and Autism spectrum disorder. I could tell he was always kinda depressed from time to time and that he is struggling with low self esteem and hate for himself. He was slowly drifting away. He used to be so in love with me, wanted to make things work and was kind and lovely and then he distanced, said he is at a dark place and from then it went downhill. He shut me out and kept on pushing me away and even broke up over text because he can’t talk. I know this is probably the end. He said he won’t message me again even though he reached out to me to ask if I am okay after the break up. Is this not only depression but also some kind of trauma? Why destroy the person you were and decide to kill the Love too that we had. I can tell it bothers him when I bring The good old times up. He keeps saying I should stop bringing things up. What happened to him? This can’t be just depression right? I know it won’t change anything but I have to get this off my chest. He wants me to forget him and move on but it was important to him to let me know nothing of this is my fault and I didn’t do anything wrong, it’s all on him. Please help me to understand. I need closure.",1

"I regret not committing suicide when I was younger As a teenager I thought about it a lot. Came close once or twice. But I chickened out. Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them. Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it. I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done. Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love. Fuck.

"Dealing with stress Hello, I feel like I am consumed with stress constantly. It doesn’t matter what the situation is I will stress about it, overthink it, and worry about it. I’m just getting so tired of it and I need ways to help. I am constantly worried about what comes next, what people think, or how I react to situations. I have tried to stop and breathe but it seems like my mind always goes back to overthinking. How can I overcome this?",1
"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. They either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out. Or just outright see you completely differently. So you put on a mask of happiness and no one ever finds out and you sink even deeper.",1
"Stress because of my face Sorry for my English) I have a really bad self esteem because I have no confidence around people. I have a port wine stain birthmark on my face and I think I also have repulsive/annoying/serious looking face. Whenever I meet people they always treat me seriously and give me the stare. I feel insecure and awkward to be around people because I always feel self conscious about my face. I have no idea what did I do to deserve those treatments. When I talk to people they see me as an asshole and they treat me like that. They are either cold or serious all the time when talking to me. It pisses me off so much. I am a quiet person and I only talk when people are initiating the talking and most of the time I am silent. I don’t smile often tho, is this why people becomes cold to me? I have no fucking idea. I have little brother and sister and they both have nice friends and their friends treat them normal. Why can’t I be like my siblings? Why do they always treat me like I am a bad bad person when I did nothing wrong? I have this face since I was born and I have no idea how having friends feel like because I had no friends since I was 7 years old, now I am 22. Because of people stares and their treatments, I became a shut in recluse and I didn’t go out because home is the only place where I can feel safe and secure. I also got bullied a lot at grade school all the way to high school. I just want to feel normal. Is this something to much to ask for? Do I really have a bitchy Face?? This is my face photos I lost my hope to live as a normal human being. I am tired living as a recluse loser for more than 15 years (from 1st grade to high school and in college too) Help me please everyone. You can judge my photo and please be honest. Give me your comments and help because I have no fucking idea how can I live like normal person without feeling insecure and being treated like a mean person. TL;DR do I have a bitch face? What should I do? I want friends so bad because I’ve never had one. I am jealous to other people who have friends. ",1
"I really miss feeling joy and euphoria I wish I still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like I did as a kid. Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time. Edit please stop suggesting drugs",1

"Help with managing stress Hi All, I’m hoping for some recommendations/advice. I feel that on a day to day, I now manage my stress pretty well. That is, until something goes wrong and then I fall apart. CBT has helped with managing a lot of daily stressors, but it feels that I reach so quickly to unexpected events, that I can’t put these techniques into action. For example, yesterday, I had a plumbing issue in my house (water flying everywhere). I almost had some kind of breakdown over it. Full on sobbing and panic, beyond what I would perceive to be a normal level. This type of stress/panic is sporadic as it only occurs when there is something unexpected happens. Can anyone suggest any kind of ways to manage this? Thank you",1

"I had a friend over for the first time in two years today She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9 30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours! I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas grinning_face ) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do.. EDIT wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3 POINTLESS EDIT 2 woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)",0

Im stressing myself out!!! So I tend to do this a lot I worry when I shouldnt.... The story is I am joining the US Army but the only hitch is my weight. I have struggled heavily with my weight for a long time but finally made it close enough to my goal to join the Army. Im going to the processing center next week (MEPS) and they will weight me and check my bmi and Im nervous and stressed and I cant sleep. Im right at the max limit and its eating me up inside. Ive got the good test score and everything else its like this one thing could push my timline back farther than I want it to if Im not careful. Now once I get past this week and i get to basic training then I should lose a lot of weight fast . Im not worried about that its just this like week before is absolutely torture.,1

"Should I stay? Please someone help me. I'm so conflicted. I've (21F) been with my boyfriend (27M) for about a year now, we've been living together for several months and have become co-dependent. I've noticed that he has some anger/emotional issues and they have been greatly affecting me. There are times where he drives recklessly, yells, gets angry at the dogs, slams things, or generally expresses his anger outwardly. He's scared me on multiple occasions, yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support. I was in denial about it for a long time and didn't tell anyone (not even my therapist) out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave. He apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but I'm not sure if it's smart to get back into the relationship (as it takes time to heal/change). Each person I've talked to has given contradicting advice, although most voted to have a clean breakup. Many have pointed out the red flags and it's making me second guess a lot of the relationship (was it manipulation? Was I stuck in a submissive role?). I think it's a mix of a lot of different things... (or am I still in denial about how toxic it was?). My logic is that if he could control it, he would have stopped, meaning he needs time to work on it. Thus, it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy. My therapist recommended taking some time apart, although that can translate into many different things (distance? a break? a breakup? etc). We've spent the past couple of weeks apart on weird talking terms and I just want to figure out what I should do. I've never been more confused, hurt, and alone in my entire life. I don't know what to believe anymore. I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I should still try and make it work. All advice is greatly appreciated and I'm more than happy to answer any questions (since this is a relatively short post). Thank you for listening. Sending my love to whoever is reading.",1

"How to explain that while being stressed isnt causing major issues yet, I know it will eventually. I have been burnt out for months now, I go through cycles that start with being stressed and overwhelmed and end with me feeling suicidal and exhibiting a lot of depression symptoms. Back in September I felt like the cycle was starting up again and tried to be proactive and get help from a counsellor/therapist. Since then I have seen 3 different people at 2 different places and nobody took me seriously. I kept my request pretty simple, I want to find sress management techniques that dont involve mindfulness or meditation or anything like that. I have practised mindfullness and meditation for nearly a decade and the results were extremely negative. I figured that cant be the only way to manage stress, but it seems like everywhere I look it all says mindfulness. My last appointment I tested in the green for streds despite feeling completely burnt out. I feel like the test questions didnt represent my situation, but idk it was developed by professionals. Guy 3 kept asking me what techniques I was using to manage my stress and I kept telling him I dont have any healthy coping mechanisms and even if I do they arent working well enough. I can feel things just getting worse and part of me wants it to, so that maybe then I could say things like ""I'm cant get out of bed"" and not ""well Im fine now but Im on the verge of not being able to get out of bed and I feel like shit all the time"". How do I get a professional to take me seriously? Is mindfulness the only option for stress management? Thanks.",1

"Is addiction causing you stress? Many of us struggle with various types of addictions - internet, cigarettes, alcohol, gambling etc. Addiction puts lots of pressure on our own self and our loved ones. How many of us have thought about the origin of our addictions and the reasons why it's so hard to get rid of these habits? One of the biggest question remains is whether we are substituting our empty lives with these habits that are no longer serving our higher goals. There are several research studies that directs us to the fact that past Trauma could be the reason for addiction. As a Coach, I have worked closely with people with addiction issues and so far my realization is that many of them had gone through some form of abuse & trauma in the past. Abuse can come in different forms physical, mental, sexual, psychological and emotional. It is quite important to identify our past trauma and get some help rather than sweeping our problems under the carpet and living in denial. As humans we all need self care and community support to stay healthy and happy. Practicing spiritual activities (meditation, mindfulness etc) will help us to heal our past trauma and wounds.",1

"feeling happier for being a vegetarian and being spiritual?! Hi, so How are you? I hope your well <3* !TW meantion of Su1cide and SH! *So I recently and other people around me have noticed im so happy. Its strange because from November 2020-march 2021 I was in a depressive cycle and self H1rmed a few times and thought about s1ui1de for a while. Now a month later I feel refreshed for no reason. I haven't done anything different to my life style except from becoming more spiritual and becoming Lacto-ovo vegetarian. I never realized such small changes can really change a person.* *Learning about farm animals more i made the decision to go Lacto-ovo vegetarian which means, no Meat, poultry or fish, but you can eat dairy products and eggs. This made me feel better for my health like eating habits and overall wellbeing. I do know that lots of people love their meat and fully respect them for that.* *Becoming spiritual well kind off * *I love spiritual things like manifesting and finding a meaning in life really helps me realize I can get through really tough dark times. Im only a newbie and I have a lot to learn but so far after a few months I really find it helps me cope!* *The moral of this is that if you feel down even in a really dark place then you have something missing in your life. Try something new even if its so small. Small thinks count just as the big things do too!* *Anyway I really hope you find your inner happiness <3* *(Feel free to follow me for any random things and coping strategies!)* Also sorry if I put it in the wrong category im not really sure as im new here!

"I have no desires no ambitions, hell I don't even think my life can be considered ""living"". But I love it and I think I will continue to live like this as long as I can, only feeling alive when it rains I live through stories, through dreams, through other people eyes, I think I've got a lot of empathy for some reason. I lose myself in everything, movies, books, shows, videogames... I don't care which life I follow as long as it isn't my own, I don't feel sad even though sometimes I feel suicidal, I even got an attempt behind me, I don't really care. I'm 23 and I had a difficult life full of loss and sickness and I don't care for that either. I'm not a dumb person but I didn't and neither intend to follow through with my studies, I don't want a job either even though I think I will have to get one in order to get by. I just want to live throughout my stories, I want to lose myself in there forever, I really wish the afterlife will be just that, an amalgamation of lives where I forget everything and every time start anew but when I die I remember all the previous ones I've lived. For some reason though there's always something that truly makes me feel alive, something that makes me happy and with which I share an incredible connection on so many levels; the rain. I love the rain so much, I always end up with a smile on my face whenever it starts to pour down, it's like some kind of miracle of nature and every time I wish it could go on forever. Rain is amazing, it's so dynamic and refreshing, the smell of dust it leaves it's the absolute best and it feels like when I can finally smell it when it starts raining, in that moment I truly feel alive. In no other instance I can feel that way or can I replicate it, I don't care for love but I think I'm in love with this weather. I think I only live to see the next time it will rain, over and over. Also the same way the rain makes me feel alive, the sun makes me feel dead inside and in pain, a physical pain it often enough translated into the real world, I swear it has debilitated me in many occasions. The heat, I can't stand it, the sweat brings stickiness, it burns my eyes, the sky becomes so monotonous it could just be dead for all I cared. Really, the sun sucks, I often wish for it to disappear forever, I don't care if I would die or the planet and all the people in it would die, I really just want it gone, every single day of my life. My first thoughts when I wake up every single day are ""is it raining?"" ""Please, please make it so today will be a rainy day"". I don't really know why I'm writing this, maybe I hope to find someone who can understand me even though I doubt anyone, even in a situation similar to mine, could feel in exactly in the same way as I do.

I feel more enabled to miss class because teachers don't really care who shows up. So I miss class. Then I'm stressed about the material I missed, but I'm too anxious to contact the teacher because I think they don't like me because I missed class. So I distract myself and drown in Netflix until 4 am and sleep through all my classes, and when I am up for them I don't go because I'm anxious I will be put down by the teacher.

I was planning days out, chatting to people more than I ever do, making jokes, laughing. Felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe.

"I just want to quit everything It's a long story, but I'll tell as shortly as possible. I'm gay so I worked very hard for my entire life to move to Europe to study and live there. After I finished my bachelor very successfully, I got very ill. Nothing too serious, but 4 separate illnesses piled up at the same time, and this ruined me. I had started a master's, but I had to quit and move back in with my family in my country. My country has mandatory military service. Being in the shape that I was and also being gay, I was in no shape for military service. So I started a master's in another field that I thought was easy, the military service is postponed if you're studying. I took care of my illnesses in the meantime, except for my serious allergy problem whose treatment lasts approx 5 years, I'm still ongoing through that treatment. I've arrived at the thesis state of my master's, but gosh, I just hate it so much. I don't want to do it anymore. It's so stressful, and also so pointless, that I just want to quit everything. I simply don't want to do it and no force can make me want to. Because I'm a very straightforward and authentic person. If I don't want to truly do something, I just can't do it. But if I quit, I would have to go to military service, and I'm still going through treatment. I could try getting an exemption by saying I'm gay, there's such a system in place, but I'm not sure if they would believe me, and I'm not sure what it indicates for my future. I can't get a postponement because of my treatment, they don't listen to that even though the actual reality is that I'm having breathing problems all day long. That's the life I have to go through. The only thing I could possibly do is to sign up to say that I'm gay. And funny thing is, I have a 3.98 GPA, so externally it doesn't make sense to quit, but yet still, I hate the program so much. It makes every awaken moment of life feel like disaster. I hate this. I don't want to be in this situation and I don't want to live like this. But yet I'm tied up and can't move on. I can barely lift my head up anymore and I don't know what to do. I guess I literally don't want to do anything. I just want to quit everything that's all. Also, I'm extremely lonely. I don't have any friends that want to see me and no one proper wants to date me either. I was doing really fine in life and I knew the value of it too, never took it for granted. I was happy. And I wanted to make other people happy too. But my life got ruined. I can't solve any of this anymore and I feel like I'm out of my mind. I just don't want to do anything anymore. I just want to quit. Thanks for listening. Any advice is appreciated.",1

"Having depression in your genes sucks I got my depression from my mom who probably got it from her dad who probably got it from his parents who ... you get the idea. And it fucking sucks because I feel like there is no way to truly help yourself when you were predetermined by fate to be a sad piece of shit all the time. I can't even relate to other depressed people, most of them just seem to be depressed because of their circumstances in life and yeah that's valid too but at least that's something that can be changed. I know it's probably toxic to say this but I genuinely hate seeing other people recover from depressive episodes because there is no escaping my genes. I will never have depression be in my past, it's ALWAYS going to affect me regardless of what I do with my life or what meds I decide to take, it's ALWAYS going to fuck me over because that's what my genes want to happen I guess lmao. Anyways seeing other people get better while I know that I'm just going to be coping for the rest of my life feels devastating, there is no escape from this shitty brain",1

"Stress / anxiety from workplace disagreements. Sorry if this is too minor for this subreddit, but I would really like to get other people’s perspective. Brief background, I have struggled with quite significant anxiety, and resultant relatively minor depression over the last decade or so. I am on medication now after having been signed off work for a month a short while ago. Recently I have felt very resilient, and enjoying the challenges of work for the first time again in years. I have had the strength, and inclination to put myself out there a bit more at work, and to have my voice heard on issues and disagreements where I genuinely feel like I know better or have something to add. This has then led to disagreements that make me feel uncomfortable and anxious again. They are probably minor things to normal people, but I can’t help but let them get to me. And once I start to fight for something I struggle to let it go which makes things worse, and then I feel worse. My instinctive takeaway from these experiences are that I should not speak up, and I need to just be passive and let others dictate as that seems to be the only way I can handle it and not cause the situations that cause my anxiety. Does this make sense or resonate with anyone else? Am I just wrong? What’s the best way forward? I just want to be happy and calm in life.",1

"23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old. I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend. Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job. Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance. The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done. Its not like Ive tried.

"Collecting Pieces of My Shattered Porcelain Soul I’ve been meaning to make a personal post for a while. It’s been… a difficult time for me, and I’ve really been struggling lately. Sitting at my terminal typing this out, I’m finding my words and sentences difficult to conceive. Perhaps this is an unsurprising reveal, an antithesis of the otherwise happy mask I don – the mask that says that I’m okay. This is unlike my time earlier this year from my situation with whom we shall call LT, and I would be doing myself a grave injustice if I were to have specified it as such; the root of my current status quo is complex and unending, not simply one-dimensional but a great web of connected, overlapping, and intertwined vertices. No, to contemplate and dwell on the sources of my pain is not why I started writing this post. It’s not why I had, if you’re reading this, decided to publicize it on the internet – expressing myself and delivering my most blatant, clear, and real cry for help was my reason. To be blunt, I’ve lost a lot of motivation and will lately. I’ve lost friends, family, and most importantly, I’ve lost myself. I know that on the surface, anyone would be envious of my life – I’m a well-respected straight-A student who’s involved everywhere both academically and non-academically, with my foot in the door all across the hemisphere and connections all across the globe, with dozens of open job offers and opportunities to ditch my life and move away and make six figures doing what I love and loving what I do, with this and that and so much more and more and more and more. I make people laugh and I make people smile – I make people feel happiness when they haven’t in a while and I stay with them and I help them and I’m there for them because that’s what I do I help people. I look like someone who has everything figured out, and I guess I do have a lot figured out. I’m a star student, a valued and highly-contributing member of everything I’m a part of and I’m amazing at my job and I exceed at everything I do. I guess I have a lot figured out, but I don’t have everything figured out. To say that I’ve lost my friends, family, and myself may be confusing to an outside observer who sees friends and family still loving me and surrounding me and myself still putting on a smile sustained throughout every shared moment, bringing laughter and light and happiness to every room I’m in. Perhaps this is nitpicking the specifics of the English language, but they’re wrong. My friends and family still have me and they haven’t lost me. I said I lost them. I said I lost myself. Anyone who’s ever felt this – and I know there’s a nonzero number of individuals who have, who do – understands what the subtle but important difference is. We understand how it’s possible for ourselves to lose the people we love and the people we care about without them losing us, because it’s not a matter of possession, company, relationship, or otherwise – it’s about identity. There aren’t words for me to describe it. There aren’t words for me to explain it to someone who’s never felt it before. I’ve been writing this for hours already, and words are so, so difficult to come across. I’ve lost everyone and myself. This life that I live, this life riddled with clinical anxiety, depression, PTSD, and a physical disability, is not a life for the faint of heart. I walk through hallways every single day, not fully accepting that I am me. I look into the mirror and see another person. This life is not a life that you want to live, so please do not be envious of it. I’m so utterly stressed. I love all the clubs and organizations I’m a part of and I easily excel at both work and school, but it’s exhausting when I have so much emotional baggage to carry on my shoulders. My PTSD’s never gotten better. My soul is not a golden model – it is one of porcelain, dropped and shattered and crushed into a trillion minuscule pieces scattered by the winds of time. I truly live two worlds one of false happiness and laughter and love, and one of the deserted land in which my consciousness wanders, a barren wasteland devoid of life, myself never truly able to be me, eternally wondering, struggling, and falling. This isn’t something I’ve only recently begun feeling, but something I’ve always felt – only repressed and not allowed to surface for so long. I’m in so much pain, and I don’t want to be in pain anymore. Impale me with a steel hook and savagely tear my heart out. I’ll never function like you; I can’t be normal, I can’t be happy. That’s been me.",1

"I get specific symptoms while doing specific tasks and need help determining how to move forward... Since starting my first real job August 2020, I've been experiencing some symptoms while working Chest pressure. Sometimes (although rarely) causing hypertension or difficulty breathing. Inability to concentrate. The symptoms may persist for some time after stopping the day's work, although rarely for long. They get worse throughout the week, and seem to be the mildest on Mondays. They are also mildest in the morning, worsening throughout the day. The symptoms are worsened while performing difficult tasks, or tasks that have no clear way towards a solution. While doing tasks that I know how to solve, the symptoms are lessened, and sometimes disappear completely. I work as a software developer. I am 24 and male. While the symptoms are present, I can hardly get any work done. I cannot concentrate or think clearly. After a workday I am completely drained, and have little mental capacity to do anything but watch Netflix. It has gotten to a point where I am drawn towards avoiding work to not experience the symptoms, hence me seeking help here. Obviously, I'm writing this post here, because I suspect this may be related to stress. I don't have any obvious stressors in my life, and generally do not ""feel stressed"". My main inquiry is how I should move forward? I've scheduled a doctor's appointment, but how do I ""treat"" this? Do I seek out psychological therapy? Should I consider another career path?

"Let go of Stress, Negativity & Emotional Pain 3 years ago I left Dubai and moved to a small town in Hungary because I fell in love with a girl. She did not want to move to Dubai so I decided to move to Hungary. I left my beautiful house, high paying job, my car, my big fat salary and my favourite city in the world behind to move in with my girlfriend. But 3 months after moving to Hungary she ditched me. I was completely broken. She left because I wasn't earning as much as I was in Dubai. I was in a town where my brown skin was a problem and I didn't speak the local language. In public I was called a terrorist, a migrant and even a gypsy. Life was tough but I fought myself out of it. Stress, negativity and emotional pain can destroy anyone.

"Struggling with work stress and making mistakes Ever since Covid kicked off I've been extra stressed from work due to managers riding everyone extra hard compared to usual. I'm a 4th year apprentice mechanic and I've been making more mistakes at work than usual. Nothing major, just little things but far too often. Leaving job orders in a customer's car, breaking things that are easy to break but I shouldn't have broken, etc. My managers have had several private chats to me now about the issues and have basically just said that if I don't get on top of it I'm fired. It doesn't help that my direct manager gets very stressed and takes it out on others, especially me, getting abusive at times. I'm currently on my 4th week of 6 weeks off I had originally booked for an overseas trip, which kind of just adds to the despair of the situation. I've started working out nearly every day when I never used to. I've cut my drinking to next to none and started eating more fruit and veg and less junk. I'm feeling good for the time being while I'm on holidays but as I get closer to going back to work the worrying is starting again and it affects my sleep. I was wondering if any of you guys would have any tips to deal with work related stress and help with focus during work.

"2 years of trying to avoid accepting that I have depression and today I can’t stop crying because of one of the stupidest reasons.

"Start of sixth form I'm not sure if this page is meant for advice in these sorts of scenarios, but I've started sixth form (year 12, ages 16-17) recently at a new grammar school. Before moving I thought I was intelligent as I was one of the smartest in my year. With good enough GCSEs I moved to this school doing Maths, English, Economics and History for A levels. As well as regretting taking English Literature, I've lost a lot of confidence in myself recently due to basically everyone being superior to me in all academics. Except from Maths I feel like I'm the worst in my other classes. In addition to this I live almost 2 hours from my school and commute by bus every day overall leading me losing motivation in working harder. Looking back now I don't know why I picked a school so far, but it's too late to move now without risking me falling behind in topics. Anyway, feeling really stupid about myself has stressed me out so much now and I don't know how to improve it. I know it's only been 4 months since the start of A levels but everyone is moving too far ahead and I really dont want to be completely left in the dust. Can someone give me ideas in escaping this situation. Thank you.",1
"Suicide survivors & depression I am seeking support as a depressed Redditor who experienced loss via suicide and had long lasting depression. My depression game from numerous genetic and life experiences. I hate to tell this story because I think I traumatize people by telling the story. My father, who my mom and me decide to leave because he was a severe alcoholic. I remember in 3rd grade he was crying on the floor to me not to leave. We left and didn’t come back cause it was bad. He tried to follow but ended up homeless. On Christmas Eve when I was in college trying to build my life, he killed himself. He jumped off a bridge in the winter in Jersey. Someone saw him jump and he was recused but in ICU brain dead. At 23 years old I was the next of kin and doctors made me decide to pull the plug and they told me, “he sent a message of what he wanted.” So I did it. It kills my heart everyday. 10 years later my best friend broke up with a boyfriend and was feeling terrible. I was convinced she was amazing and enough to find someone else and wanted to distract her by saying let’s go to a psychic to prove that you will find someone else. I did a reading too (super skeptical- my first reading and I thought it would be fun- not serious) and she said to me I see suicide in your life. I replied, it was as my father. She told me that he was not meant to be on this earth and she honestly relieved me of a lot of guilt. I recently got super depressed and thought to myself, if he was not meant to be here and I’m a product of him, then I’m not meant to be here. I struggle with that because all my life I felt a burden.

Just as the title says, math stresses me out to the point where I break down and start crying. It's been happening since I was 8 or 9. I was trying to revise this particular topic (congruence and similarity) for my upcoming math test next Tuesday and I kept getting all the questions wrong, and I just broke down and started sobbing because I feel so fucking stupid and dumb and this test is super important as well and my dumbass is studying last minute because I just want to avoid math for as long as I can. Math stirs up terrible emotions inside of me for some reason. Anyway, I feel fucking terrible because I keep trying and trying and not getting any better, and also because my perfectionist self is afraid of failure and that's exactly what I'm doing failing. I can't believe I thought that I would ace this stupid fucking test when I keep procrastinating and crying. In conclusion, I am fucking delusional and I want death. Fuck school. Fuck math. Fuck all this dumb perfectionist bullshit I can't seem to shake. I guess I'm just gonna fail. Yay!",1
"I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do. I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am. I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me. My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income. I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off. All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them. I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways. **EDIT I'm seeing a therapist online.** **EDIT 2 I can't say I'm feeling better than I was yesterday when I posted this, but... a Platinum, a Gold, Silvers, so many kind comments... I truly don't know what to say. I wasn't expecting this to get so much traction, and I'm so close to crying at seeing so many people reach out and...** ***care***. **I'll try and respond to everyone when I can. Just... thank you, everyone. For helping me feel a bit less alone.** **EDIT 3 Well... I don't know what to say. I was okay for a few days after posting this. Now the weight in my chest and the bad thoughts are creeping back in again. They just... are. Every single time I think I'll get better, and then nothing at all.** **It's like my body wants to be depressed. Now I'm just... fighting myself. I want to surrender.**",1
Can the root cause of my groin/penis numbness be chronic stress? I have been stressed for far too long. It’s chronic. Recently my penis and groin has become numb. I was concentrating on it for so long as well. I don’t take medication. I took some ashwaganda prior the numbness but numbness began 1.5 months later taking ashwaganda. I was wondering the root cause of my problem might be stress related? I checked for everything including ms neuropathy and other problems. I ruled out everything. Anyone has a similar experience? My sensations do not change throughout the day the sensitivity is just same.,1
"I'm so fucking tired of begging for help. I NEED HELP. Being ignored is why I'm going to wind up dead. I'm so tired of my feelings being ignored by my friends and family. I'm tired of the emotional abuse I have been through. I'm tired of dealing with having bpd. I literally cannot do this anymore. I CAN'T. I feel so empty and nothing feels worth doing, I have no friends, and I'm hurting. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way. I genuinely believe that in killing myself I will finally find some peace. I truly don't think anyone cares about me or that this will hurt anyone, but I'm sorry if it does. I'll be watching over you from above and same to anyone dealing with these same issues. I'm sorry I just can't do this. Edit Thank you for all the awards and comments I have recieved. I've done my best to reply to reply to all of you because I appreciate all of the time people took out to comment on my post. The amount of love and support I have received is overwhelming. I hope you all know that the I reciprocate the love and care you have shown me. You guys gave me some hope and even made me cry a little. I feel better and if anyone else needs help, please reach out to me so I can pass on this good energy. This made my day so much better. I love you all. ",1

"I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and.. I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. Edit I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly.",1

"My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks. She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total. After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? Just needed to rant and vent a little. So if anyone actually read this far, thank you red_heart ",1

"Being Daddy is hard, but it's the best... TLDR; I'm so tired, but I can't leave my little girl. My daughter is a few months shy of turning 2 years old. She's normally been a great sleeper and has given us very little trouble at nightimes (or at least compared to some of the stories I hear from our parent friends - I know how lucky we are in this regard). Anyway, the last few weeks have been a slightly different story. I don't know why but she's been waking up and crying out for us in the night a few times more. Other than her nightime waking, she's also not been napping properly durng her day (denying us those precious few hours to get some jobs done without being interrupted or just having a quiet coffee). On top of this, both of our jobs have been horrendous (my wife and I work in health care, which is a tough sector to work in during a global health crisis). My wife is also recently pregnant and dealing (very admirably) with the whole morning sickness thing (I don't take for granted that she has a much tougher deal than me - you women are awesome!). Anyway, when my daughter called out for me an hour ago (it's 3 o'clock in the morning BTW), I had to steel myself to go into her room and settle her calmly. Anyway, I'm on her bedroom floor right now, watching her sleep and I've got my hand poking through the bars of her cot - she's holding my finger tightly and squeezing them every now and again as she breathes. The thoughts going through my head are these - one day, far sooner than I'd like I'm sure, she's going to want me to ""LEAVE ME ALONE"" because ""you're so embarrassing"" or ""you just don't get it!"". Lol. So, although I'm tired, I want to go back to sleep and God knows how I'll manage work tomorrow, I really don't want to let go of her hand. Ever.",1
"I’ve thrown everything away I tend to get in bouts of self destruction where I throw away every relationship I’ve made and very few stick around. I never wanted them to.

"Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them. Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. I've been depressed from childhood and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood. I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care. Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite ""reaching out"" to them. They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others. Edit Thanks for the support and awards. Also, I changed the ""all"" to ""some"" in the 4th paragraph because SOME of you are so sensitive about that and it was your only takeaway from this entire discussion.",1

"Small Improvements After a Very Stressful Month So I've been sick with the flu this past week, as well as just been burnt out the entire month. I've been exhausted physically, as well as unmotivated and overly anxious. Today, I managed to eat a somewhat good breakfast despite having loss of appetite, and I took all my meds. I eventually took a shower (washed my hair and shaved a little) and brushed my teeth and put on fresh clothes for the first time this week. I even mustered the energy to tidy up my depression mess in my room. I'm in bed again, just resting, but it feels good to have accomplished those things. Hopefully I start to feel better soon so that I can get more stuff done. I don't want to be an unmotivated mess anymore.",1
"Seeking for a listener Life’s been really difficult for me the past few weeks...It’s not that I don’t get support from my family and friends, it’s just that they don’t really understand what I’m feeling. I am having difficulty expressing it. In school, other than the tremendous amount of weighted assignments I have to deal with, I still have to be committed to my cocurricular activity afterwards. I’m currently struggling to play my instrument well, I tried. I really did try, but there’s no motivation for me at all. I feel so demoralised every time the conductor singles me out and makes me play alone, finally concluding that my junior plays better than me and I shouldn’t play for that part. As a senior I really feel ashamed but I don’t have the time to stay dedicated to practices. Studies is especially important to me this year and people just don’t get that I have my own priorities too. I recognise my mistake for not being passionate enough but I really feel that there’s nothing I can do about it, it’s already too late. This whole cycles just keeps repeating itself - me trying my best to score well, me going for band, me getting scolded in front of everyone, me feeling really sad and demoralised, me crying when I get back home, me doing my homework till midnight...I’m trying my best to stay committed to everything as much as possible already, why can’t they understand? Why do I feel like they are just trying to prove me wrong by shaming me? Thankfully, these practices are stopping in June and I can finally take a mental break by then. If you are reading my post right now, I would like to express my appreciation Thank you for sparing your time to listen to me....Typing this post really did help me a lot, at least my feelings do not have to be bottled up anymore.

"You can never have an honest conversation about suicide When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute shit storm. My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety” If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. ",1
"First steps- think I might be depressed and don't know where to go initially So, I’m not sure exactly what sort of mental health professional I need to make an appointment with (therapist, psychologist, etc), but I feel I need to and would appreciate any advice. I’ve been feeling not quite myself for about six months now. I know everyone is dealing with issues trying to live through a pandemic- and I had been holding up fairly well until just recently. Right before the pandemic, my dad died kind of unexpectedly, and I really hadn’t been able to spend time to grieve that before we were thrust into this weird time we’re in now. I would not say I am severely depressed, but it’s almost like I have the pervasive question in my head of “what’s the point of living/ what’s the purpose?” To be clear- I am not suicidal (in fact, the thought of killing myself is extremely scary to me- I’m scared of death). But I just feel kind of ‘meh’ about life lately. I feel like my emotional bucket is empty. I don’t know if this is just really persistent right now because of the current pandemic, or if I need to be medicated. And then, if I did need to be, how that works. Is that something you can do to get you over the hump, or is that something you have to be on permanently? TIA!",1

I do love my girlfriend but I’m scared of the commitment because I feel the further in the rabbit hole I go the harder it will be to have a chilled lifestyle again. I wish I could work part time or not at all. But obviously that would mean a dull existence and loneliness. I’ve done it before but my life has improved a lot now and I don’t want to give it up. I’ve tried taking time off work but the thought of work and other things are just stressing me out still. I got so stressed that I did try splitting up with my girlfriend but my mental state wasn’t right at the time so we got back together.",1

Depression meds after losing a loved one? Just wondering if others have done this? If it helped? If it’s not a good idea? I loved two of my best friends in the past couple of years and still have a hard time grieving their losses. They were brothers to me. Died in their early 30’s. Both were heroin overdoses. I’ve tried a couple therapy sessions since then and they kind of helped. Would getting prescribed medication be a good idea? Or am I just masking the underlying issue of grieving. I was prescribed Zoloft years ago for depression (lost another friend to suicide) and I don’t really know if it helped or not. I took it for a little less than a year and then got off meds..,1
"I'm having heavy anxiety, depression attacks very frequently. Situation includes vitamin deficiency, I ask for experiences you have had. Can Vitamin D Deficiency Cause Such Effects On Me? Hello everyone, I've been having anxiety attacks for a year and a month and most of the attacks were happened in last 3 months. With covid pandemic, we couldn't go outside and a result of this was vitamin D3 deficiency for me. I am 16 years old, male and I'm aware of what my age brings upon me. I fought against myself for almost a year, got the blood results and sat very disappointed. I knew myself very well and I'm not a person who gets affected by emotions so easily. And I didn't have anything can hit me to ground. Just nothing. I knew it was a biological thing but with these circumstances I couldn't get any help. I want to describe myself,my problems and the help I want to have from you. I'm a very thinking person, have so much opinions, knowledge on many things. I love philosophy and music. These two things are my favourite in my life. Sadly, I can't even remember myself, thoughts, artists i love, songs i live with, past I had lived and so on. I've been having these compliments since February 2020; can't remember things, can't think about anything, can't concentrate, always feeling tired and the list goes on. Long story short, I kinda have a fog on my brain (I thought about this when i was new to these). I always found a solution for my problems and never disappointed myself but I can't get out of this anymore. I fought back with this 6 times maybe and I don't have any morale to stand up for one more time. I can't express myself anymore; my school, relationships, inner peace is getting effected heavily everyday. I'm losing my abilities, my skills are diminishing, my creativity is fading away. I can't listen to music anymore, can't find a purpose, can't use my time efficiently anymore. My Vitamin D3 results are on the floor. The low vitamin limit is 20 mg/L and mine is 5.4 mg/L. I started taking 3.000 iu daily supplement for almost 2 months and I am a lot better than before but the psychological consequences are still upon me. I talked with a friend of mine and they said you may have anxiety. I agree with this, my last few months corrupted by it and depression. I am not a depression person and know how to fight against but heavy stress from my school is blocking my way out and I feel hopeless. I'm afraid of losing my thoughts, my mind, my personality, everything I love and care, interest in my hobies. I read that vitamin d is the background of these diseases. Also I'm having sleep problems for months, this is a factor too. Please enlighten me if you know about this and had experiences. Thanks. I'm sorry if I used english bad, complicated. I'm in a very tough situation while writing this, please understand me, I can't even write things in my mind I'm so sorry about this.",1

I don’t care anymore I’ve been forced to be homeschooled. I can’t talk to anyone. I feel alone I miss talking to friends and them being there. I’m failing most of my classes.

I sometimes lay in bed and cry for hours because I haven’t talked to anyone besides my parents and siblings in 4 months.,1

"Work environment stress So hi. I’m a new ish mechanic in the field. I know some but not all of my job obviously. I’m the green horn. At my job, we have few employees. It’s actually only about 4-5 mechanics, a shop boss and a couple others. For the most part the job is good. Good pay, good training opportunities, good foot in the door. There’s just one problem. One of the most experienced mechanics on the floor, is the grizzled vet type who doesn’t sugar coat things and makes me feel pretty worthless and dumb if I approach them for guidance. The stress or anxiety of even thinking about approaching this man is to a level where my stomach physically churns. (This is not an over exaggeration). Each day I dread more and more, going in to work. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of environment, stress, or person before. The kind of being that can instantly make you your stomach turn to knots. I just don’t get it. I’m miserable. I’m miserable in a job I thought I loved. Help me. Please. ",1

"Anyone else stressed to the max about the general state of affairs everywhere?. I had so many issues I was already dealing with before Covid-19, the near-economic collapse, riots, political corruption and election stuff, etc. I'm living in a dump of a place, caring for an elderly person and an aging pet and I've got health issues myself. Our state is one of the highest in the nation for infections/deaths from Covid-19 so when I developed a cough and low-grade fever, it felt like just one more kick in the guts. After going to the ER, turns out I just have an upper-respiratory infection and my lungs were ""perfectly clear"" according to the Doctor I saw. Still, it was scary!. Then there's the news (I read way to much) and every day it seems like there is some kind of political crookery going on or we *might* go to war with China/Russia or the end of the world is near...blah...blah...blah.

"homeless in 3 months so background info we were planning on selling our house before buying a new one. our current house has 2 rooms and i (19F) share a room with my sister (16F). the real estate market in our country is INSANE, most houses are apartments and a small 3-room apartment costs upwards of $450k for a 99-year lease. mom's friend coincidentally was looking for a house in our area, and she offered to buy our house for 365k, inclusive of a 3 month extension period before we have to move out. everything goes smoothly, until she chooses to back out the last minute before the legal agreement of ""reserving"" our flat expires - effectively wasting 27 days of our time. By now, we already have an apartment we wanted to buy - settled on the price (488k) which was a steal in a city-fringe location. so now we have a buyer who's still interested in buying our house - and they offered $360k without the extension, because their own extension on their current house is expiring soon too. parents accept the offer, and tell me and my sister. rendering us homeless in 3 months because the new house has to undergo renovation for a few months starting october(most likely complete in jan 2022). continuing in comments because my phone is lagging out due to the word count.",1

Regret +medical school = mess Every day is a struggle because I am tormented by my thoughts/memories of the last few years. Every happy moment is tarnished by my anxiety/trauma from everything that has happened. I put myself through sheer hell of medical school. Every day was hell. I struggled so much. I spent every waking second revising because it was so difficult for me. I neglected everything else in my life. I eventually passed. I’ve failed first year as qualified doctor and currently resitting. I have so much regret about medical school and also university life and everything that happened there. I chose medical school for completely the wrong reason. I was dead set on living in America and thought the best way to get there was to have a good job like a doctor. So that’s why I did it. I was never good at science. I hated it. My life was art and French/languages at school. My OCD style obsession with moving countries and making as much money as possible lead me to this mess. I’ve had thousands of disciplinary meetings throughout medical school because of my poor ability and avoidance and resits etc. I just can’t cope. I hate every day in hospital. Every second is torture. I am the exact opposite of a people person I hate working in teams. I detest science. Why did I force myself through this. Why didn’t I enjoy my life and choose something enjoyable that I was truly good at? My school even nominated me to do early A level for art at GCSE because I did so well. I’m just appalled at my life choices.,1

I can’t change that even if I try as hard as I can. I have made a big decision and resigned but my contract keeps me there for January.

"I (18F) think I’ve actually found a genuinely good guy Gosh this is so crazy... Y’all this man...is honest to God the sweetest and most genuine guy I’ve ever talked to. He actually cares about my day and what I’m doing, likes talking to me throughout the day, he never calls me sexy or hot or anything, but he always says I “look so pretty” or “beautiful” or sweet things like that. He lives a long way away from me so we’ve never met before grinning_face_with_sweat A big plus is that he’s never asked for nudes. Every single other guy I’ve liked or been with has asked for pics/videos all the time. I just had learned to expect it. But this guy doesn’t do anything like that at all. Honestly I didn’t know that guys like that existed anymore grinning_face_with_sweat but here we are. I’ve had 2 boyfriends my entire life. The first one was my best friend for 4 years before we dated, and the other was a guy I kinda met ok the fly and decided to date him. Both of those relationships crashed and burned. These were recent too, so I was a little scared to talk to other guys again. I don’t know. I’ve just never talked to someone who is so genuinely happy, caring, and encouraging. I’m a musician, a HARDCORE musician face_with_tears_of_joy , and he is not, but he is always supporting everything I do musically (even though he might not know wtf I’m doing haha); I’m about to release stuff with my band and he’s so excited for me!!! It’s just so nice. He does something completely different than me; I don’t really understand a lot about it but, like he is, I’m super open to learning about it and being excited for him!! Well guys. I’m just so happy with this. He said he might be coming to where I live for some event, but he said we are definitely going to meet. If not this time, we will eventually.

"I am too lazy at this point to do anything that I should be doing Hi. Darn it. I was working on awesome projects. Like an anti-anxiety chatbot and stuff. And an online indie game. All was going well. Until about 4 and a half years ago when haters have been stalking me online, documenting everything I do, saving everything I post and putting it in a google drive folder, and people extremely often messaging me with threats and mean messages like this [ [ and it keeps happening. and they keep harassing my followers, too. So, I feel like taking a break from my main account. I already did before but the haters that cyberstalk me somehow found them all. so I've already made like 10 email addresses and accounts already before. I'm running out of stamina... and it's too noisy here. So here's a list of things I gotta do, but I can't get myself to do it because it is too much work for me nowadays make a new email account use that to make social media accounts where I game and vent about how noisy it is here. (I was doing that on my main account, but the cyberstalker troll guys would backup everything I post and re-post it on youtube without my permission and twist things around.) make another new email account. use that to make social media accounts dedicated to, well, everything that I am a huge fanboy over. make yet another new email account use that to make awesome gaming videos where I am not constantly venting about how I can not stand how freaking extremely noisy it is here at this apartment that I live at. make another email account again use that to make a podcast with a female voice changing program and attempt to somehow redeem and defend myself (my old main account) with it. Not sure about this yet though, that might be a bit too shady to do, idk. I do have a female side to me, though; I mean I'm a femboy to be honest, so.. make yet another email account use that to make videos where I can actually cuss if I feel frusterated. I don't usually cuss, and I like to keep my content family friendly. So I'd like to post videos where I play games and talk about subjects and things that tick me off, where I actually cuss, and I'd like it to be seperate from my other main gaming account that my family would probably subscribe to, so that I can cuss and have it for 17+ people, so that I can cuss in the videos without worrying much that I might be a bad influence to anybody. ok but I don't wanna do any of that. I already made like 10 email accounts before and such. I'm getting really sick and tired of it. I really wanna do all of those things that I listed and I have been wanting to for awhile now. But I don't wanna make yet more accounts, it's just soo tiring to me now..",1

"Tips on handling stress in a call center-like job (and work stress in general)? So two months ago I impulsively quit my last job--a remote phone-based tech support position. At the time I really felt like I was between a rock and a hard place, my anxiety was through the roof and it seemed like the best option. At first I felt way better, but predictably when the money ran out I started panicking. It was then that I realized that *every* job has ""made me stressed out,"" and to a degree the problem is how I handle the job. But I'm not sure how to improve that. Part of me feels like if I *don't* heap tons of pressure and stress on myself, I'll suck at the job. And there's a bit of that Protestant work ethic at play here--feeling like my performance at work is a direct indicator of my personal character, and if I even slip a little bit it's a sign of a huge flaw on my part. I'm starting a new job next week, ironically the exact same job I stress quit two months ago--just with a different company. Being away from it (and comparing it to the options I have otherwise) has made me realize it was a good job in a lot of ways, and I *was* competent at it--I just got stressed too easily. How can I keep from being a stressed, frazzled mess at work while still applying *enough* pressure on myself to be competent at my job?",1
Does anyone ever feel physically too weak. Everyday I experience a rush of weakness or something. It’s hard to explain.

"My mom died yesterday My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast. I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. I want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously. Never forget that that may be the last time you’ll see them.",1
"Why do people shame me for having an opinion It feels like people don't really know what they want from me. Most of the time I try to be reserved and keep my opinions to myself.

But then when I do speak up, they act like I'm a bad guy for saying anything, completely dismiss me and make me feel ashamed for daring to have an opinion. My opinion is always wrong, and hurtful, and whatever, but somehow when others sometimes have a similar opinion, it is respected, and encouraged, and openly discussed. Then the same people are surprised I act reserved and tell me they always thought I'm just introverted (I'm not) when it's them who are the cause for this.

"Good step towards progress Hey everyone, I just joined the group and I think I should share a relatively good breakthrough I had with my stress management. I work a grueling job as an essential worker at a grocery chain in the midwestern US. This job has really seen me go through the ringer in regards to bending over backwards to make my company happy. We are the number one store for sales in the company, and one of the ways we are number one is through our online ordering where we seem to have a “no ceiling rule” where we with accept X number of orders per hour. To where, around thanksgiving. We were doing easily 30-40 orders a half hour (roughly 10 containers to hold items/order). Couple that with me being the pallet puller who pulls all the orders out to where we let people drive up for their order. Couple it with a thankless job where they’re only using me for my size. It gets to be stressful. Anyhow, last night I cracked and I decided to start medicating with OTC stress relievers. So I bought some of that Ashwagandha stuff or whatever and took one about 6 PM last night (two hours after my shift) and it was amazing. I didn’t feel quite as stressed, and as someone who lives naturally with a lot of stress/frustration (due to a Spectrum Disorder) and a high stress job, I felt honestly the best I have felt since maybe before COVID-19 took over our lives. Honestly, I hope to leave the job soon due to the stress causing me a lot mental struggles outside of work.

My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced.

First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try. I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading.",1

"My parents told me to kill myself My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore Edit I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them.",1
"Work stress so bad causing daily mental breakdowns and sleep deprivation I’ve been working through a major life for the last few weeks (breaking up with a life partner - together 12 years and living together 5 of those). On top of the personal stress of breaking up and moving during covid, my performance at work has been poor. Despite repeated attempts to correct bad behaviors with the support of my company and manager, My performance has not improved and I am experiencing nearly daily mental breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks. I am also not able to sleep for more than 3-4 fitful hours a night. At this stage I strongly believe quitting will be to the benefit of everyone. I won’t experience the intense stress and anxiety just the thought of logging on to my work station brings and my company can get someone in to do my role with more consistency and success than I.

"Workplace harassment Hey everyone. So basically I feel that I’m being harassed at work and it’s now affecting my home life because of it. I’m having crazy anxiety going to work, I’m literally holding back tears all day long and have had incidents where I’ve had to go cry in a closet or bathroom, I’m getting chest pains off and on, and overall I’m feeling like I’m loosing control of my emotions. I don’t know what to do, and my doctors advice in the past has been to just “get back on that horse and keep going”. I’ll explain the situation a little. I work at a hospital doing housekeeping. Now covid has been stressful but my management has caused me more stress than covid has. I’m a part timer on a full time line. That means that I have set shifts and hours. My line was Monday to Friday with weekends off. I was working in a covid unit and then was moved to icu to deal with cleaning covid in there. Through that my hours did not change. As soon as summer season started they decided to change my schedule to every other weekend off. The catch there, I was the only one who had their schedule changed like that. Management stated it was because of overtime, however there has been no overtime being offered. On top of that, I have been trying to now get them to switch my rotation of every other weekend off to accommodate my life. I’m in a serious relationship and with this new schedule my partner and I have literally no days off. I addressed it with my management and they refuse to do anything about it. So now my summer is ruined. I also brought this up to the union at my work and they did next to nothing about it. These issues mentioned above are literally the icing on the cake. There are literally so many problems with my workplace. I’m currently looking for another job but with me being so emotional and whatnot I’m really struggling. I just don’t know what to do. I’m feeling trapped, scared, angry, frustrated, and defeated. After 10 years of working at one workplace I really don’t know what to do.",1

"It’s Happening Again I can feel it. Building inside of me. I can’t stop overthinking. My thoughts are like a river-constant. I can feel my soul screaming internally. I can feel the mental breakdown that hasn’t happened yet. And I don’t know what to do. The saddest part of depression is that while there are resources out there, those of us with clinical depression know that only time is the answer. The light at the end of our dark tunnel. Time has to pass. But what do I do in the meantime? I feel myself becoming unmotivated, isolated, fatigued, reminiscent, and I begin to daydream about random things. Envy is the ugliest color on someone, but lately I find myself wearing it. Looking at people and wishing I was successful like them, happy like them, loved like them, and beautiful like them.

"I’ve NEVER had a day start out as good as today has. I work at a Wendy’s burger joint at the moment, usually at the drive through window. And anyone who’s worked fast food will know that it’s rarely a fun job. Well, today started out with a bunch of rain. Our store doesn’t have an awning, so I was getting soaked. Pretty typical so far. But then it was just rapid fire wholesomeness. I had one of our regulars hand me a $5 tip and tell me that I deserve it, and that I’m a great worker. I had a pretty damn attractive person ask for my number. I’m already engaged, but that felt really nice to hear. And just before my break, I had 5 customers pay for the person behind them in a row.

"I'm dying, all alone. Hello Reddit. I'm a 54 M who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease. According to doctors I have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body. That, however is not what I want to talk about. I've had a hard life. I spent most of my childhood all alone, with no friends, always desperate for tiniest bit of affection. My parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me. While I'm deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me, back in that time I didn't understand any of that. All I could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didn't. I did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention. So many stupid and embarrassing things that I don't remember anymore since I really don't want to. Overall I hated my childhood. I've never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because I was comfortable with it. However since a long time before I stepped into my teen years, I knew I was maybe a little bit different. I hated sports, instead I really loved reading books, there were some other examples but like I said, I don't remember much about my childhood. I also didn't think they were a big deal. When I became a teenager I discovered that unlike any other teenage boys I knew, I was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason. I thought that I'll probably get there in time. I didn't. Now, I was different, in a very conservative and judging society. A society which even divorced people get looked at with anger. When I realized that instead of getting attracted to girls, I like boys, I panicked! I was only 14, I knew very little, I thought I'll get out of this mess as I grow older. In that period of time, I thought I was the only one like that. I was DIFFERENT. for the rest of my teenage life I ignored that, hoping for a change in my preference in the future. When I grew older I became aware of what situation I was in. I was, ... gay. Even to this day I can't say that word without my voice shaking. I tried everything to change, it did not work. Many many questions were raised in my head. Like ""Why am I like this?"", ""How am I going to live like this?"" I encountered a huge moral, religious, and cultural dilemma. It was horrible. Untill this day I've got no answers. It was simply so much for me to process. This quickly affected me and became a major source of depression, anxiety, social insecurities and etc. I gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path. Due to all the stress and anxiety I encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages. Then I went through a severe phase when I was 18 in which I tried confronting myself. I tried my best to accept who I am. I didn't want to change, just wanted to come clean and admit it. It was not successful. I fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety, from 2 of my friends whom I came out to, one refused to believe what I am and one cut ties with me. My best friend, even though he could not believe it, was actually supportive, but soon he moved far away in a different state. I had no one to talk to. My family didn't know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse. I couldn't stand how sad my parents would get if I told them what I was. After all they did for me I couldn't bring tears to my mom's eyes and sadness to my dad. I spent about a month just waking up, eating, and staring at my room with no purpose. I finally had it decided. After 32 days I started planning my suicide. Everything was set on that day. I already did everything and I went to bed early that night so that I'd be ready for the big day. As I was tying the rope around my neck, I heard my little sister's laughter. I burst into tears. Once again I was being selfish. How could I make her little heart sad? How cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that? I stopped. I knew this would happen again if I don't make any changes. So I did. I promised my self never to think of that issue again. I suppressed my sexual desires. I kept myself busy with other stuff so that I wouldn't get distracted. I was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what I was. I could live my pathetic life again. When I was aware of my condition, I made myself a promise. That I wouldn't emotionally hurt anyone and that I don't do anything about my sex life. Fun fact, I'm still a virgin til this day. Despite my family's pressure, I didn't get married. How could I force myself to like a women and ruin her life. Why would I start a family which I can't love the way I should. Why would I ruin someone else's life because of my selfishness. I didn't date or confess to anyone either. As far as I knew, I couldn't live with the emotional weight of accepting who I am. How could I enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person? The night that I made myself that promise I very well knew this means I will die all alone. With no one to hold me, hug me, or kiss me. Funny how I still crave human contact though I didn't have any even when I was a kid. Rest of my life was boring. I lived. I had a good job with good payment. That's it. I never felt happy. I had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings. I never told anyone what I was again. I lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door. And now I have cancer. With a much more limited time than ever. I'm actually kinda happy, it'll all end soon. I only wish I could be happier, without all these regrets. I would've wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but I can't imagine how would that go. I'd also wish for me to be straight but I honestly have no idea how that works. Not once I was interested in women to have a sense of that. I even tried looking at pictures of ""HOT WOMEN"" ( it's hilarious I know. ) for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didn't. So, at the end, I'm soon dying, never kissed the person I loved, or even met the person I loved, full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness. I don't exactly know who will read this, I never got noticed in my life I don't see why I should be noticed now. I also don't know how much time I have left. So I say to the world, farewell, I didn't hate you but I hated myself the most.",1

My day. Today I tied a belt around my throat and hung it from the ceiling. I was standing on the edge of the chair when I slipt. The knot was t strong enough and came untied from the ceiling and I fell. All through this my girlfriend was ignoring me because my suicidalness upset her too much and she couldn’t handle it. I got back up. Tied a stronger knot and tested it. It would work. So I put the belt around my throat and stood there. Stood there waiting. Hoping I would get a text from my girlfriend. The only person I have in this lonely world. No reply still to the moment I’m writing this. I stood there for about 45 minutes pushing myself to jump. To just end it. It’ll be over in about 2 minutes I told myself. Then I can be at peace for once. But I didn’t have the courage. I’m fearing for my life lately. I’m scared one of these times I’ll actually jump. I’ll be gone. I’m getting anti depressants tomorrow but I’m worried they’re not going to work fast enough. I’m at my breaking point. Life is so dark and lonely I don’t know what to do. I don’t understand how people enjoy life. I’m struggling. I’m fighting but my mind fights back harder. So if this is my last message. To the only people who will care. Goodbye Reddit. You are the only people who have ever shown genuine support.,1
I’m 17 with a baby and I have to say… I am so incredibly happy with my life right now So I live with my boyfriend and his family. We have our own loft upstairs. Before I moved in here I lived with my family who got evicted from our homes repeatedly and never had anything. Now my boyfriend and I essentially have our own place and I have a tv! The tv can play Netflix and Disney plus so I can watch tv in bed. I have a queen sized bed! I have an amazing boyfriend who I dearly love and I have a daughter who is literally named after rays of sunlight because that’s exactly what she is to me. My life seems hard and pathetic to so many people but I’m doing well in school and I’m very pleased with where I am. Everything is great!!!,0
"You can't kill yourself, think of your family! Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after. Edit I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem. That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",1

During this time, we've had visits from our agency that come and conduct wellness checks on both the living conditions of the house and also to see how we're doing, especially her. And every time it's gone smoothly and perfectly, at least for their requirements. So we had another visit from them today and this was what we anticipated most. It was just more paperwork to be submitted to the court as well as an official Petition to Adoption that we needed to finally complete. While me and my wife were doing this though, one of the other agents sat with our daughter privately to just talk and ask how things were going, if she genuinely wanted to stay with us, anything bad that was happening that we weren't telling them, etc. And at the end, they brought her back in and said that now, all that's left is for them to submit everything to the court for a judge to review. They said that hopefully we should expect a response within 30 days but oftentimes it's sooner depending on how clean the background check is and a few other things. ""We're almost there"" she (our agent) said. It's funny because our daughter, while she was extremely happy with how everything was going, wasn't nearly as filled with joy as me and my wife were. My wife was actually crying and couldn't contain herself. She nearly smothered her in her arms giving her a bear hug. I hugged her too and just looked her dead in the eyes and said ""We're almost there baby girl"" before kissing her forehead. I mean I just don't know what to say or how to say it at this point. This is like a dream come true with everything we've lost but also have gained so much more in the process. It breaks my heart thinking about how many other kids her age or around it (she's 14) are out there but will never have a permanent home like she will. But, I try not to think about it and am just thankful we have a kid as perfect as her in our lives.",0
"How am I supposed to stay productive at work? As far as my therapist is concerned I have depressive episodes. I'm on medication but I still have bursts of... Wtf, how do you call that? Just episodes, I guess. Thanks to the therapy I can handle that in day to day life. Except for work. I sit here, 8 hours a day, trying to do important work but just failing completely. I can't focus on anything, even writing mails is hard. It makes the episodes so much worse too, because I feel like an ultimate failure. My boss knows about the depression and that I can't work as hard as I should, but even his support doesn't help the situation. Is there any way, some of you get around this kind of problem, even just for short periods of time?",1
I don't even know if this is normal So for context I'm 14 and a male and I have massive adhd but the problem is I'm always thinking and these thoughts can range from good ones it bad ones and the problem is when I tell my brain to stop thinking about something bad my mind just floods me with that one thing to the point were I get mad and then get stressed because I stop thinking normally and if I try day dreaming this memory out some how my brain incorporates that thought into my day dream and I need help P.S. thank you to anyone who responds,1
"i am so thankful for my best friend, she’s like my sister and i love her ) i’ve known my best friend for about 6 years now, and i’m just so happy that she still spends time with me. i’ve never really been able to keep a close friend for more than a couple years, so it’s just so great to just have someone that you can trust, someone that you know appreciates you like you appreciate them. it’s so nice that we get to spend so much time together, and we never run out of things to say or feel like we can’t express ourselves around eachother. i can envision her being a lifelong friend, and i hope it stays that way. that is all )",0
"Would really appreciate some help getting back on track and finding happiness Early this morning I had the worst anxiety attack about my life and thinking what's the point. I've dealt with depression for so long I can't even remember what it feels to naturally be happy. I also seem to always have negative thoughts and thinking super down about myself and things around me. I really could use help and guidance in terms of things to watch, read or do to at least get me on track. I was on effexor for 2 years, but wanted to get off due to some of the side effects and once I finally got off after lower each dose I thought I was going to start feeling better which seems to be the opposite.

"I feel like I'm right back where I was at the end of 2018, and I fucking hate it. No love, no happiness, and nothing but the clothes on my back. Quarantine has been draining me and taking away literally everything that I had left that made me happy. Now, I can barely pull myself out of bed. I'd rather lay there and let the days fly by until something else happens. Preferably death. Nothing is working for me, and I feel like I truly have nothing right now. Quarantine took my job away and left me unemployed. Unemployment insurance hasn't been coming in even after claiming it every week, so I have no money. I still have yet to receive any kind of stimulus check. My fitness has gone right back downhill, and I can't even get myself to do any basic exercise. The person I gave my heart to is still out there, doing...whatever she is doing in Colorado. All of my plans for this year have been steadily getting cancelled. I still live in a shithole area of the world, and have thought every single day about where I'd like to move to in order to escape this hell. And today I ran into the girl I saw months ago, and hoped to see again...and I couldn't even get myself to say hello. This isn't the end of the world...but it feels so much like it.

"Talking to my Dr. tomorrow about adjusting my meds Hi all, first time posting in r/depression. I (F/42) have probably been battling it all my life but it was manageable until I had kids. I likely have mild ADD as well. I used very intense exercise to cope with both before. I still exercise every day, but I can’t do it with the same intensity that I used to because of my age, previous injuries, and just the fact that I have no time to recover from intense workouts. My main symptoms are irritability (likely caused by anxiety), feelings of hopelessness, and loss of interest/inability to experience happiness. I go through the motions but don’t experience enjoyment on any level. I feel insecure and stressed in social situations. I’ve worked with a therapist before (have gone through many, in fact) but have found the process unhelpful and even harmful at times, but that’s a different post. I struggled for a year and a half to find a medication that would work for me but I’m extremely sensitive to side effects. Here is a list of what I’ve tried so far and the effects I experienced, both good and bad. Zoloft (Sertraline) - drowsiness, emotional flatness, loss of interest and creativity, some relief from tearfulness Trintellix (vortoxetine) - upset stomach, g.i. Issues, no discernible relief from depression Prozac (fluoxetine) - very intense headache. Only took it once Lamictal (lamotregine) - (off label) allergic reaction itching, redness Lexapro (escitolopram) - hair loss, nausea, no relief from depression Wellbutrin (bupropion) - anxiety, nausea, no discernible relief from depression Cymbalta (duloxetine) - I was prescribed this, but was actually too terrified of the side effects to take it ADHD meds Adderall headache, backache, major crash helped with interest and focus but I felt too bad to do much Dexadrine headache with crash, helped with interest but not focus Ritalin sedating Vyvanse helpful with interest, mood, and focus. Extreme irritability with crash. I am currently only taking 25 mil. of sertraline. Any more and I can’t get up off the couch. Any less and I don’t sleep at night. It’s obviously not cutting it but I’m absolutely terrified of taking anything else. I don’t have a support system to take up the slack if I’m sick for longer than a day or two. My relatives all live far away (and they’re not very helpful anyway). My husband works all the time, as he is the main breadwinner. I have a friendly neighbor or two, but not someone who would take the kids for more than a few hours. It’s me or nothing, and I think that might be a big contributor to my problems. I’m talking to my psychiatrist tomorrow but I know he’s kind of out of ideas. I’m thinking about asking for the lowest dose of Vyvanse possible. I have no clue what to do about the antidepressants. He doesn’t want to repeat a medication and he doesn’t want to prescribe older meds as they tend to cause more side effects. Is there anything we might have missed? Are there any combinations or supplements that can make side effects more tolerable? Thanks in advance.",1
"Stressed out of my mind and trying to hide it So I’m 15 and recently my family bought our first apartment (we used to just rent). It was already stressful at the beginning looking for an affordable yet good place cuz my dad was worried about not being able to pay rent for any longer due to Covid and my parents not being able to work. So fast forward we move to the new place and hand over our old apartment. I don’t really want to go into the details, but long story short my dad is planning on suing the seller of the new apartment for misleading stuff. Meanwhile at our old place, there’s a possibility of them suing us. And now, I’m just fucking scared tbh. I’ve never had the word “sue” applied in my life before and it’s still taking me time to process the situations. We’re in a fucked situation and me being 15 and not knowing a lot regarding this, I’m really scared and worried for my family. My dad and my brother are managing all of this, so I don’t want to burden them even more with my emotions. I got the news of all the suing 2 days ago, and since then, I’ve been having panic attacks (rarely happens for me, I don’t have any mental health conditions) and hiding up in my bunk bed to cry. We’re also just an average family so I’m really scared about how all of this could affect our financial situation, and what would happen if we lose. I’m also really worried about my dad. Since Covid started, it has affected my parents’ business a lot so he had to take car of that, along with finding a new home and then the moving process. Now all the suing and he can’t even catch a break. My mind is just running with a lot of fear and anxiety from the moment I wake up to me tossing and turning in bed at night, which I’m having trouble containing. I think I’m even having those hypertension thingys cuz my head hurts all the time. And whenever I’m on my phone and I read smt related to law or legal stuff, I just feel like crying. On top of all this, I’m trying to do my homework but sitting at my desk, this just resonates at the back my mind. I know writing this on here is pointless cuz no one can do anything, but just letting it out to strangers has helped a little bit. Im still pretending to act normal towards my friends and family but my soul feels lost. I’m also not in the mindset of “why is this happening to my family” but moreso “how the fuck are we gonna get through this”. I’m just...really scared.",1
"I'm unaware of what counts as stress So I've had uncomfortable physiological responses while studying/taking a test for a while now.

Then, i decided to call for therapy instead and i got an appointment right away and i’m already meeting with a psychiatrist this weekend! i had no money to attend my first appointment and they called an uber for me so that i could get some help! they paid for an uber there and back home. my intake is done, now it’ll just be phone sessions. i was very anxious and almost didn’t go but i did and i’m so happy that i did ) i can’t wait to get back on my meds and start to feel like my normal self again! this is big for me bc i’m always in my own way. i’m still shocked i left the house. i usually look for every reason not to, even if it’ll help me. just wanted to share that bc i didn’t have anyone else to tell edit this isn’t a post telling anyone what to do or promising a fix. trust me, i know meds and therapy isn’t for everyone. this is just my own experience and me being hopeful ) a huge!!!! thank you to the folks who have left kind words. red_heart you’re very much appreciated. i’ve replied to as many as i could lol thank you! i hope that you all find some peace.",1
"I feel too sensitive to exist Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness. My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand. How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone. Edit this post is open to anyone wanting to express their feelings. Unite fellow fragile people ) Edit 2!

"I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die. Edit thanks for all the responses! Let me rephrase something here. I dont wish I had cancer. I wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. I'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes.",1
"I’m so stressed from my home life I can’t focus on school work and my grades are paying the price Recently, my mom has been very reckless, narcissistic, abusive, etc. she’s been causing me a lot of physical and emotional stress. She’s been taking out her issues on me and my 8 y/o brother. All issues SHE created for herself. She somehow manages to blame someone else her her shitty life, whether it’s her parents or me. I’ve given her so many chances and this was the last one. But all of this is causing me so much stress. I’m constantly anxious. And when I think about having to go back home I start feeling like I’m having a panic attack. My heart beats out of my chest, I get nauseous, I start sweating and my hands start shaking. I haven’t even been able to eat because of the stress. The thought of food alone makes me wanna vomit.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed. I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever. I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty. All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone. Edit thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily. I really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood.",1

"Depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive.

"Friends make all the difference in the world. I've said this on another post I made a few hours ago, I moved a lot growing up. Across multiple states and different houses and apartments. I got to see a lot of cool things and meet interesting people. But it was killer on the friendships. It's hard to meet someone and establish yourself as being worthy of keeping in touch in such a short time. Naturally people ebb and flow in and out of your life. Always will. But it definitely affected the way I look at building meaningful connections and how I interact with those bonds. Everything was very temporary for a long time. Earlier I was in such a bad state. I'm going through a breakup. It was seven years and I met her when I was nineteen. I hadn't eaten in two days, and I think I might have been dehydrated from my medication. I just wasn't paying attention because I was so utterly empty, emotionally. Very tricky time. My mom found me passed out because I slept all day, probably from just not noticing how I was treating my body and it decided to have a little revolt. Anyway, My mom made me some food. And she just hugged me. And I felt comforted. Warmth. Really warm. It was remarkable that at twenty six years old, I felt as much as I did from that simple long hug. I ate my food and just sat with her, blearily waking up from my stupor. I was really groggy and had a hard time thinking properly. It was like sleeping the deepest of sleeps and waking up from it abruptly. We talked about how I was feeling and I just was content to be sad in her presense for awhile. It helped in a way. I told her later how grateful I was for her. She's a good mom. I go downstairs, I can't even remember why. I think I just wanted to move. And I get a phone call from a coworker, who helped me call off earlier that morning because I was feeling particularly not well today. And so I picked up. You guys. I'm very lucky to have the people in my life that I do. I have never had something like this before. The people I work with are the most charming, sincere, kind, and loving people. They came and got me, thirty minutes away, took me to a bar, fed me and got me drunk. And I couldn't stop laughing. I couldn't stop smiling. I am feeling fuzzy from my head to my toes. I just got dropped off at home. Things are going to get better. And it's moments like these, where as low as I am, people have a way of being able to lift you right on out of that no problem. I'm still very sad. I'm not ready yet. But one day, maybe, with time I will be. Until then I'll just practice. Love your friends. Cherish them deeply. Same for your family. Sometimes they are all you need.",0
"Self-hatred is exhausting I’m so hard on myself for not getting as much done as I want to but when you’re battling self-hatred and your mind is constantly asking you why you even bother with anything when it’ll never turn out the way you want it- when you’ll never be good enough to be loved or accomplish anything-it’s just exhausting to push through those thoughts.

"Constant tension and stress for years. Hi everyone. I’ve realised recently that I can’t remember the last time I was truly relaxed for a constant period of time since I was 17 (I’m 23 now), apart from my first year at university. It feels strange to realise this...I remember the feeling of being relaxed after a nice calming bath or having a scented candle burning, but I really don’t recall a time that I wasn’t worried or tense about something?! Like there’s always something at the back of my mind or an issue I’m really worried about, I’m never truly content with my life! In the past year I’ve developed a few health issues, all of which have been traced back to being too stressed. More recently it’s neck and shoulder tension and jaw pain. I guess I’ve reached a point where I think ‘enough is enough’ and need to work to change this aspect of who I am, which has been ‘normal’ for 5/6 years. I find it hard to discipline myself with things like yoga, meditation and other mindfulness activities, because of the tension, but also the fear that it may not work. But if I never commit to it, it won’t have an effect. My GP told me to do a little bit each day so I get used to the practice of it. I’d love to know if anyone had been in this situation or can relate. Have you got any tips on how to move forward? I want to be less tense and learn how to manage stress better. Thank you!",1

My few friends are moving forward, are happy whereas I'm stuck and never been in a relationship. I don't have any motivation, or goal my life seems dull and just not worth it. I don't know if I have like i dunno any kind of pathology, should I go see a doctor or smth like that ? Or am I just moping on my pathetic life like a child ?",1
"Stressed at work, let's crawl in a hole and stay there I work at a cellular retail shop. You would think it wouldn't be stressful, right? Well, it isn't normally...except for the fact I run the retail shop. I run the retail shop, handle corporate customers (which is a full time job in itself), take calls for a call centre the owner has decided to run, train and supervise new employees (which takes the whole day) and do various other tasks and tons of follow up. My things to do list is so full, I needed another page. On top of all that, I'm not a morning person. I work mornings.. fuck.. just fuck... I asked my boss for more hours after the store closed to finish my tasks, so she extended the hours at the store. I still can't finish my tasks, cause it's a retail store and we still help customers face to face, and my new staff can't handle customers yet. Can't have them accidently signing up the wrong person for a contract, or doing whatever random things they accidentally do.. I wear yoga pants to work, they're comfy. My coworker walks in sweatpants, I told her you can't wear those. My boss calls me, you can't wear yoga pants anymore... Fuck... seriously she wore yoga pants when she was working all the time. She doesn't anymore because she stays at home, and works at home. So yeah...I think it's unfair. She told me that i don't have that much to do, and she probably could have handled all of it no problem..I just have poor time management skills.. I'm seriously doing my best, it's stressful when people are complaining it's been 2 weeks and they haven't got something. I'm like...fuck it's a different department I have to rely on. My records tell me I've been following up every other day...what the fuck am I supposed to do when the person I'm relying on is fucken useless. It's really hard to keep a good attitude. Thanks for reading, I'm going to go cry and smoke now.",1
"Something is wrong with me. I really need help hi. i need help, there’s something wrong with me and idk what it is but i need help please. This will be a long post so i would really appreciate a whole lot to those who read this. But also I’m sorry for any inconsistencies with this post. I am really bad at writing.. so to start off, I only have one emotion. I believe I do because I don’t ever feel sadness, anger, or anything else besides “happiness”. I don’t know if it’s a habit of mine but I just smile even though I don’t feel a thing. I laugh when something is funny but It’s been a habit of mine since i’ve been a kid, i can’t help but laugh or smile, even at serious stuff. I guess i’m fortunate enough to have this one but only my family can make me do that. They’re actually my only will to live. I don’t feel a single thing when there’s something supposed to be sad and there should’ve been so many moments where i should be mad but i just can’t feel something. This was more evident when my now ex-gf broke up with me suddenly. She said that she doesn’t love me anymore and i just didn’t feel a thing. I loved her so much but here’s the thing. Before she broke up with me, I would feel sad, worried, and even mad at one point but after that. I think something within me broke and i finally just gave up on everything as a whole. I don’t take interest anything anymore, like dating. I used to always want to date people as a way to escape my depression, find comfort and find happiness. I felt that during my last relationship. (Side note Over a few years ago i dated this girl which left me damaged/scarred so badly that it still haunts me to this day. I won’t go into detail about that). Second, i don’t ever feel like eating anything. sometimes i’d go for a full 12 hours or longer without food because 1. It’s a pain leaving my room and 2. I don’t feel hungry. I refuse to leave my room most of my time and would occasionally eat whatever i have in my mini fridge. (it would be bread for the most part) Third, i have major insomnia. I just cannot feel “tired” unless i stay up for an entire 24+ hours. But when I do sleep. I would always wake up around 6 30pm and ALWAYS at that time. Even if i pull an all nighter. My body mentally and physically refuses to wake up earlier even though i want to but i don’t have the strength for it. All i do is sleep for over 14+ hours. I really really want to fix my sleep schedule. I tried so many methods but they always all fail. Finally, I refuse all social contact. This doesn’t apply to my family or essential workers. I cannot look at people in the eye and i’d always hide my face with a hat + mask (even if the place doesn’t need a mask but i’d still always wear it regardless of what they say). I don’t have anyone to text and if i do get a text. i wouldn’t see it for days. My speech has been getting worse cause of it. I live with two friends but i haven’t seen or talk to them in over a few days because i’m always in my room. Idk if i sound so dramatic but there’s something wrong with me. I’m extremely good at lying. I hide it so we’ll with family and close friends who happen to see me (which is super rare). I just need some help. Also please don’t tell me to go seek professional help or go to a hospital. ive been to therapy in the past but i hate it. I just don’t feel comfortable with it face to face with someone. Again i’m sorry for the way i type and for any inconsistencies.",1

"Treat Yourself Like You Treat Your Best Friend Hey Everyone, just wanted to share this quick mindset with you! Did you know out of the \~30,000 average thoughts a person has a day, 80% are negative and 95% are repetitive? As a result, our minds begin to automatically, and subconsciously have negative thoughts. Cognitive Behavioral Therapists call this “Automatic Negative Thoughts” This leads to stress, anxiety and fear.. A great way to help this is by adopting the mindset “treat yourself like you treat your best-friend. A great starting point is to reframe any negative thoughts you have about yourself. Instead of “I’m not smart enough to do this”, try “I’ve already learned so much, and will continue to learn. This has been shown to boost both your health and happiness.. Put simply, If you wouldn’t say it to your best-friend, don’t say it to yourself. Hope this helped you!",0
"recently I have been under so much stress I have been helping my parents out for the past couple years and I feel so pressured to continue as on of my other siblings help out nearly as much as I do. school has also just been a major contributor to stress and I feel the need to show no negative emotions infront of my family, even though they would understand. I have just been bottling it up, and every couple months just been crying for a couple hours for a night. and it feels so bad because I actually don't want to help my parents anymore because the stress levels are so God damned high. I am only a teenager. i shouldn't have to deal with this amount of stress daily. to make it worse I have a sibling who is suicidal(not actively attempting) but I try to play games with them as much as possible, even to the detriment of my school work. it has just been so hard to cope with all of this. I know bottling my emotions is not a good way to cope, but I don't have any other way I know of. I tried going on a run, that only helped during it, not after.i really need some help with this. Edit my parents also get annoyed at me for not waking up to my alarms and sometimes just strait up waking up late. I feel so much pressure. I have straight up not done math assignments because of the pressure I feel to keep everyone happy. I really love my parents.

"I don't know what to do and I need advice. Hello, I'm 15, M. I don't know if this is the right sub-reddit. If it is please correct me. Let's go back to September 2019, I had begun feeling slightly depressed and had no motivation at all. My grades went from 70s-80s average to 40s-55s average. Only class I did well in was Business because it was the only class which I was interested. On the second day of my school year, I met a new friend. We'll call him Jax. Now Jax changed everything. He was and still is my brother from another mother. Fast forward 3 months and he leaves back to the US. He was here on a foreign exchange program. When he left everything returned. I began feeling depressed, anxious and stressed as fuck. Not to mention my exams which were to happen in 2 weeks. I didn't give a shit about them anyways and we had a school trip to Geneva, Switzerland and this trip was everything. It was amazing. I return to the school after a week, and exams began the week after. I failed science, had a terrible report card and my mom was embarrassed of me and called me a disappointment and even went as far to threatening to kick me out. She ended up destroying my PC which i built as a birthday present, and video games was my escape to everything. I got my shit together out of fear and started feeling even more depressed and my stress levels were high af. ",1

"I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression. I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing. at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",1

"Just a release of stuff I've been dealing with So a little under 3 months ago I renewed my lease with my roommate.  Then, about 2 months ago, my roommate told me that I he planned on moving out with his BF some time so that I should keep an eye out for a new roommate.  I assumed he meant for after our current lease was up.  About a month ago, I found out he’s going to be moving out real soon and that they had been searching for, and shortly after found, a house to get together.  If I absolutely have to, I can budget super hardcore and carry out to the end of the lease on this 2 bedroom apartment on my own, but I’m searching for a roommate because I’d prefer not to have to use an entire paycheck on just my apt bills.  My best option would be to find a roommate.  My second best would be to take an offer my apt complex gave me to move into a 1 bedroom here and carry out to the end of the lease without any extra cost other than rent adjustment.  The issue with this is my current rent is about $440 after being split with a roommate.  If I moved to a 1 bedroom, my rent would be about $730 entirely on my own, plus electricity, wifi, etc added on top of that.  My 3rd best option would be to move out, end the lease early, and find a 1 bedroom somewhere else.  The issue with this is that we’d have to give 60 days notice, plus 2 months rent (so 4 months total) for ending the lease early not to mention the cost of starting over at a new place and all that comes with that.  And unless I found a place and got approved VERY soon, I’d be most likely moving in November in Nebraska; where weather is a roll of the dice with disadvantage at the best of times.  I have had no luck with finding a new roommate and all of this is causing me a lot of stress.  My current roommate is a good dude and is kinda trying to help out, but I don’t think he thought this through.  Most of my time lately is searching for any other options or any potential roommates but none are coming to me. On top of that, I have a financial meeting in the next few days to discuss long term savings plans and a bunch of other stuff that I’m not entirely prepared for so I have to cram getting all of that ready in a very short amount of time because the stress of all the above made me forget about the meeting until just a few days ago. I’m trying to not have a breakdown about everything but shits hard.  Most of my time when not working at my job or on the above is spent sleeping as a way to try and escape the stress of it all for even a few hours, which is more difficult lately because of said stress. If you read this, thanks for taking the time.  I just needed to get some shit out into the void of the world.",0
"I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression? The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story. As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"". I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life. I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!). The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources). If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing. Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try. Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time? How can I keep up or have more energy? I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?) What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression Any secret self-help/feel good tips? How do I make more friends and build a better support network? What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days? ",1
"Depressed and anxious These days, it really doesn't take much to turn my mood upside-down. It can be the smallest, most insignificant things that gets me from feeling ""okay"" to becoming super depressed in a mater of seconds. It feels like I'm in the ocean, and just as one hand reaches the surface, a large wave will come crashing down and I'll once again get swept up into the currents and sink back into the water where the ocean floor and water surface are indistinguishable. Once again, I'll be lost with no directions. Sometimes, I can't help but question what is the purpose for trying so hard when it always comes to not. Like striving for the impossible, why? I don't get it. Where's the point in all of this. It just makes you more miserable and everyday more exhausting and suffocating. I hate life. I hate it all.",1

When my tutor of almost 5 years was asked about my compatibility with Architecture major he replied that he doesn’t think I’m a good fit. According to him, I’m not good at logical thinking and problem solving and my friend would be a better fit for the major than I am. Everytime I want to be confident, his words just repeats itself in my head and I can’t stop hating myself for not being smart enough. I can’t stop feeling frustrated because it feels like no matter how diligent I become, all I am is diligent. I hated the fact that he was correct about me not being smart enough.

"I made it. Yesterday I went to a clinic because of my injured leg. While I was talking to my doctor about my injury, suddenly I had an urge to talk about what I’ve been feeling for the past 5 years. It took a lot of courage since I never talked to any adults about it because I was too anxious and scared. I cried, my hands were shaking and I couldn’t really talk properly but what I knew was I finally seek a proper treatment. I knew I was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it. I’m only 18 years old this year and I’m currently studying at college right now. I’m embarrassed when I remember the way I broke down in front of the doctor. But I did. I finally talked.",1

"Being in nature reduces stress and blood pressure - but crucially also stops us ruminating on the past and future Spending time in nature makes a huge difference to our mental health; research has shown it can decrease our stress levels, reduce our heart rate and reduce our blood pressure - but one of the most interesting effects it has is to reduce how much we ruminate, how much we attach ourselves to our thoughts. When we get swept away by our thoughts and lose touch with the present moment, suffering isn’t far behind. Being lost in the past and future drives a great deal of our sadness and anxiety. Where nature is incredibly powerful is in its ability to focus our attention, taking us out of our heads and into our surroundings via our senses. And aside from all that, it takes us away from the information bombardment for a little while, away from our work and our phone and the TV. So when we give our full attention to a bird that's landed on a tree or take the time to look at the different parts of a flower we’re giving a minds a break and bringing ourselves back to the only place we can be happy - here and now.

You will find your group that all supports eachother. You will find meaning to keep going, you may not find the reason but you will find why and who to keep going for to support them and to have them support you is amazing. Just give it TIME.

I can't disappoint our coaches who've put so much into this, I can't give up and let us fail, and yet if we don't get the insurance and they don't let us start bang on the start of term, I reckon it's going to kill the club anyway.

"I was 30 pounds overweight, overly stressed, and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea. I was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room. Life Lessons from the Flight Attendant + Tools I Use for My Self-Care “Be sure to adjust your own mask before helping others,” says the average flight attendant. We have heard this phrase a dozen times, but we feel so weird about the thought of putting ourselves first before our loved one or child. Why does this feel so selfish and wrong? Culturally, we are expected to be strong and almighty at all times! We say things like “I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” or “I can’t slow down because my work won’t get done!” Unfortunately, we have all felt this way at one point in our lives. Some of us even feel this all the time! Let me tell you my story of how I had no choice but to put myself first. >*It all started with these 6 words “You have Hodgkin’s Lymphoma-Stage Four.” My husband got diagnosed with cancer in December of 2017 at the age of 27.* Our typical conversations about paying bills and doing laundry seemed insignificant. It didn’t feel real.  While all hope was not lost, intense stress, tears, and fear of the unknown filled our lives. I was 30 pounds overweight, overly stressed, and my body was responding in the forms of chronic pain and nausea. I was coming apart at the seams and was on my own way to the emergency room. However, as a mom of an energetic four-year-old, I did not have the option to fall apart. My little girl could not have both of her parents terminally ill in the hospital. This was the beginning of my personal healing story. I wanted my life, and body, back. So, I took control by putting myself first. I began by putting a higher priority on self-care by fulfilling my nutrition, exercise, and spiritual needs, and I continue to do this to this day. **What would ‘putting yourself first’ mean for you?** Would it be that you finally have a reason and gain the perseverance to put your self-care priorities above all others? Would it mean that you would use nutrition and exercise to fit into that outfit for the wedding you were invited to? Would it mean that you could take the stressful guesswork out of your healthy meal planning by having a system in place for dinner on those busy nights full of after-school activities? Again, this idea of putting yourself first is not new. Think back to the mundane instructions from the flight attendant. **My challenge for you Find one way to put yourself first this week and don’t feel guilty about it!** Schedule a 15-20 minute guided meditation session for yourself. Check this one out on SoundCloud! [ I also use the app insight timer for some amazing FREE meditations. [ Or tell your spouse to watch the kids for an evening and schedule a one hour massage at a local spa. (This is my favorite!) OR, be rebellious, and take a day off work to stay at home and recharge!

I am done with this family, when I have a job I will move out and live my own life. My Dad is a bully since I was little, bully me and tell me to go kill myself before. My mom poured bucket of dirty water on me in front of everyone last year in the beach because she thought I did something and never apologized. In the edge of falling in depression again. Plus I moved to Pennsylvania for 6 months, lost all my friends. If I were honest of how I felt, I would say I have been sad for 6 months straight, I always feel alone but I get happy if I talk to anyone online and sad all over again. My aggression came from all the bullshit I came through for years, reached out for help ended up lying for *THEY'RE* sake and yells at me. Involved police and cases in our house many times and investigation for 4 years straight. Really tired of this, I dont care if I'm rich or not. I just want love and affection that I've missed throughout my childhood. Can you believe being so sad for 6 almost 7 month straight? Seriously nobody cares about me. Even my best friend if I were honest, is nothing to be half of the time. I am always there for her when she is sad but, HOW ABOUT ME?!?!!??!? I'M so sick of this shit!! I got almost all straight A's in my school but unlike other parents and families, they don't even care how well I do they only care that I go to school. I want to live but I am struggling to catch up. Help?? So sick of this, this is why I dont even like to go out to vacations because i always know it is going to be a disaster and then be all blamed on me, -sincerely, me in the beach unhappy being blamed again on a vacation.",1
"You're 22, life is still ahead of you!"" It isn't. It doesn't get better, in fact, this suffocating state, where I can't hold a conversation to save my life, where am I too petrified to do anything else but be lifeless husk and go home to sleep - it side winds me a lot more than it used to. No significant other, no big plants for the future, no joy. I really don't want to wake up tomorrow. Sorry if this post isn't quite up to snuff, first time using this platform, I just wanted a some-what public space to get this shit off my chest or indulge in it, I suppose.",1

"How to work without being stressed? Hi! I am a college student (F 20) and premed. I am at a competitive college and doing reasonably well academically. My issue is dealing with stress when it comes to workload. When I have too many tasks to do, too many assignments or studying to get done, I feel very overwhelmed and very stressed and upset and sad. I am just 20 and life is easy for me honestly, so I feel very irritated at myself for stressing out to much. When I stress, its difficult for me to work as well, I just want to lay in bed and vanish from the world for the whole day. I just want to be one of those chill, happy, carefree people. The kind of people who can just do all their work but without being so overwhelmed and feeling hopeless. Honestly, I am capable and always get things done and keep a good record. So, why do I always feel so hopeless and behind? I just hate feeling stressed. I know in the back of mind i don't need to stress, and if i didn't, i could just do my work. I am not depressed btw. So, any tips? Thanks a lot",1
"phrases im tired of hearing it gets better"" for fleeting moments at best ""you are loved"" by who lmao? you, who doesn't even know my name? a stalker? ""temporary problem"" well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever ""theres so much to live for"" well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable ""what about your loved ones!"" okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet ""just exercise and drink water"" omg...thanks star-struck /s ""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?"" yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am ""just put yourself out there"" ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. ""god-"" shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. ""choose to be happy"" my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

"How to cope with never beeing alone? Well like the title says. Techniques on how to relax even when I'm never alone? A good year ago I needed to move and the intention was to temporarly move in with my parent to find a new place. But then covid came and the prises of house skyrocketed with no end inside (for now). And on my own it's about impossible to buy one at the moment (also a stressor). So I'm a bit stuck there. I'm an introvert and I really really need my time completely alone. And at the start my parents went a weekend away, went on holiday so I got my time alone once in a while and I could cope. My dad had a heart attack in april and with that went my alone time. He still needs a second treatment but that gets delayed time after time. So they stay home and like every weekend (when I'm free) friends and family visit. I need my weekends to relax a bit and now they are the most stressfull days of the week. Because I need them to be one thing and they now are the opposite. I got a couple of hobbies. Biggest one of which is woodworking. I mostly do everything from my mind, like calculating, measurement etc. and I need to concentration. But whenever I start within minutes one of them comes by all interested and bla bla and puls me out of my concentration. Finally done, within 15 minutes the second one comes and does the same. And short my dad always starts helping as he is bored as hell. But he doesn't have the energy so everything is very slow and blocks me from enjoying any of it. Also explaining every step gets old. My hobby is normally my escape from reality and he makes it his and that stresses me out big time. My escape became a stressor. But how do I say to my dad, please go and do something else as he can't do much at the moment. Now I have 3 weeks of holiday (first already gone) and I mostly sit in my room making plans for what to build, play video games and build lego sets. As that is the only thing I can do without being interupted to much.The what you want for diner, I'm going to the supermarket, I need this will you get it for me, can you help with, want some thea, etc. So even then they make it very clear I'm not alone. My mom just doesn't get it, she is an extravert and everyone should be like that is her opinion. She isn't going to change. My dad I never had a problem with but since he's sick he has been a bit different (understandably). He needs an escape aswel and chooses whatever I'm doing. I 'm getting very cranky, restless during the day, annoyed, just stressed out. In the last 2 weeks of my holiday I really need a way to calm down and to relax. As if I start working again with this mindset I go nuts. Sorry for the rant but any techniques, ideas, food (suplements), whatever that can calm me down short term are very welcome. Long term, my dad will have his second treatment and they will go out again, and I will find my own place again.",1
How do y'all deal when depressive episode hits? It's happening again. I have been doing good for a month. Working on myself. I don't wanna get sucked into darkness again. Help,1
"A burden. No one wants to spend time with a negative person, no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time. No one wants to hear bad things, complains, issues that others are struggling with. None of this is fun, so no one truly cares, no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more. Most people are selfish and that's ok. People don't own people. Everyone deals with things and that's ok. So I'm giving up asking for help, I don't want to bother anyone anymore. I don't want to upset others, waste their time... I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything! I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, probably because I've isolated myself completely and I guess, subconsciously I might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting I desperately need help, I'm ignoring loved ones, messages from friends, everyone and I don't even understand why. All I know is that I had enough of feeling lonely, enough of this unbearable pain, enough of hurting myself because I can't take it anymore.",1

"UPDATE] I'm (probably) getting back together with my old girlfriend from middle school tomorrow night and I haven't been this happy in years! (Spoiler alert SHE KISSED ME!) I. AM. OVER. THE. MOON. [Here's the situation, if you didn't see the first post.]( ALRIGHT, so a few nights ago, I invited my old girlfriend from middle school to come over to my place and watch movies. We’ve been hanging out for the last few months, getting to know each-other again, and I’m so, so happy. I’ve been considering seeing if she wanted to start dating again for months, and I finally decided that I was just going to do it and see what happened. I have a friend who I got to do some \~recon\~ for me, and he was 100% sure that she was just waiting for me to make a move, so I wasn’t nervous about her saying no or anything. I was just hesitating because getting into a relationship with someone you really like is nerve-wracking, and also probably because I’ve got some horrible problems with intimacy. Dab. ANYWAY. My roommate was home, so we spent some time playing board games together, which was awesome. But after a bit I texted her like, “Hey, need to hang out with this lady alone for a bit please let me have the living room.” And so she did. And it was just her and me. I made dinner, which was awful because I’m not a great cook and I meant for us to go out to eat somewhere, but we both bike places, so that wasn’t realistic. So we had a meal of very salty stir fry which she somehow managed to eat without complaining one time. While we were eating, we put on a movie. We started the night on opposite sides of the couch, but I (being the subtle and suave woman of the world that I am) got just a little bit closer to her every time I got up to refill my water (which was a lot). Until eventually she called me out and said that I could just sit next to her if I wanted. Which I did. So I did. And I sort of nestled into the crook of her arm, and she put her arm around me, and I rested my head against her shoulder. Gonna be honest, folks, coulda cried. It’s the most *right* I’ve felt in years. Probably the most right I’ve felt in, oh, something like eight years and three months since she moved away the first time. It was like putting on glasses for the first time when you didn’t know how bad your eyesight had gotten. I didn’t realize how much happiness I hadn’t been feeling. Just being close to her like that again was such a rush. But a weirdly calm rush? Like after you’ve been running for a long time and you finally get to flop down in the grass somewhere. I felt so much stress that I’d been holding on for *years* just melt. Gone. And I didn’t even worry about what I was doing or if I was going too fast or if I looked stupid or anything like that. I didn’t worry about her thinking it was weird that my hand was on her stomach. Or if I was being too affectionate. I was able to just stop thinking and enjoy the moment. Feeling her breathing. How soft her shirt was. How *great* it felt to have someone hold me for the first time in ages. And I was so relaxed and so content that the words just slipped out. “We should go out again.” Didn’t fret about how I was going to phrase it or what she would think or how it would affect our friendship. Just said it. And she didn’t say yes. She fucking *kissed me*. She put her hand on my cheek and leaned down and put her lips on my lips and she *kissed me*. I wish I could say it was my first kiss, because the other ones were really regrettable, but it was my first kiss with her. I remember how often I would stress about wanting to kiss her when we were alone together. Drawing comics in my room, or watching TV, or doing homework or whatever, and I never did it. And I *always* regretted not doing it. And now we’ve done it, and it was beautiful and fantastic and I’m gonna scream. I can’t stop thinking about her. I’m smiling all the time. My friends don’t recognize me when I’m not miserable! Every little thing about her just makes me grin like a loon. She called me by the silly pet name that she had for me in middle school. I didn’t know how much I missed that. And she held my hand. She kissed me at the door. AHHH. We get to hold hands in public and I can introduce her to people as my partner and we don’t have to hide that we’re dating anymore because we’re adults and who cares what anyone thinks! I don’t remember the last time I was *giddy* like this! And, of course, I’m also terrified! Because I’ve spent a long time in therapy trying to learn how to be vulnerable with people and silence my brain when it says that my best friends are going to get shipped off to Mexico at any moment, so getting close to people is dangerous. And I’ve been trying to learn how to develop feelings for other people, since I obviously couldn’t have a relationship with her because she was in Yucatan for all I knew. It feels regressive to date her again when I’ve made so much progress trying to get over losing her. And I worry that I’m romanticizing her. I don’t think I am (at least not too badly), but there’s always the voice in the back of my head telling me that I only love this person because she used to be my middle school girlfriend. We’re both totally different people now, and I’m worried that my brain is just settling into this relationship because I want those eight years back with the girl I knew. And I want her parents to like me! I mean, they *do* like me, but I want them to like me as her girlfriend. I want them to approve of me as a partner. Apparently she’s out to her dad, which surprises me a little, but he always seemed like he might be cool. Her mom still doesn’t know. She’s very religious, but my girlfriend (AHHHH) says that she’s trying to get better about LGBT+ stuff since Pope Francis is cool with it, so maybe there’s a chance? Anyway, I’m dying over here.

My profile is a kinky mess (alt account for lonely nights), so please ignore any NSFW stuff you see.

"I've read that we aren't aware of 90% of what is going on around us. (In terms of energy, electromagnetic fields, vibrations, spirits, angels, brainwaves, wavelengths, frequencies and ect.) Personally I believe in this especially because I've experienced a lot of events that many would consider ""weird, hallucinations, paranormal and spiritual"". For example, I went to bed to my girlfriend who just had fallen asleep a couple of minutes earlier and right after laying down I saw this glowing green orb exiting her body, coming in front of me as if it was looking at me and then reversing outside my bedroom window. I'm 100% sure it was her Spirit.(light body or whatever you wanna call it.) One time I was Meditating ""Buddha style"" with my eyes halfway closed and saw this huge glowing golden orb approach me. Nowadays while thinking or talking to someone I get to see these shining small orbs appear out of nowhere and stay there for a while. All varying in different colours. Nowadays I mostly see blue. All of this has been happening to me since 2013 when I've started Meditating and getting really into spirituality. If you are interested I've made this [YouTube Video]( about which method of Meditation opened my awareness to be able to witness these sightings. Let me know your thoughts on it!",0
"If you guys have been experiencing this, probably best to tell someone about it I’ve been under tremendous stress lately with work, my car (which i fucked up backing out of my driveway), and my relationship, and lately ive been having more and more nasty thoughts that arent really normal for me to have. i consider myself a down to earth dude with a lot of good hobbies and friends that keep my mind occupied, but the amount of stress ive been having has changed the way i think and behave in public, for example i have been socially checked out for the past couple of months, something that people have been pointing out to me recently. its caused me to lose track of my schedule and ive gone back into having recurring episodes of severe depression and im smoking cigarrettes on the DL, also not normal of me. worst of it all has been my thoughts, where i would randomly, without any provocation, think about the most fucked up things i could do to someone or something. i think its important to note these things because i feel like im not the only one in this position either, and as a person that struggles with mental health, i know its important to at least put your thoughts on text no matter how embarrassing. ill list a few specific examples of what some of these thoughts have been. -i was driving down a freeway and thought about running off a bridge at 65 mph, as well as running over pedestrians on the sidewalk without any feelings -i thought about shmacking my grandmas head with a frying pan for no fucking reason -i was on the line about deciding whether or not to push my friend into a lake when i know he cant swim well those are just a few of those thoughts but i love my family and friends and would absolutely never voluntarily put anyone in danger. i dont exactly know if these thoughts are a by-product of my stress levels or if im a straight psycopath. again i really want to reiterate that i am a good person and its super abnormal for me to think something as horrific as what i described. if you also have these thoughts you should DM me or even comment bc no matter how embarrassing. its honestly relieving my stress right now just typing this out. thanks for understanding im going to post this elsewhere as well to hopefully help more people too",1

"Work related stress is ruining my life I work as a manager in retail, for background I’m only 21, I’ve had anxiety all my life and I was also diagnosed with bipolar depression last year. I’m also a college dropout. I’ve worked seasonally at this job in 2017, then came back again in 2018. They decided to keep me and eventually I worked my way up to a manager position earlier this year. At the beginning I did enjoy working here and helping people out. But I have been recently feeling extremely stressed and burnt out from work. As a manager I have a long list of tasks to do everyday, while managing others, and dealing with customers. I would say I’m a hard worker, and getting tasks done is normally doable for me. The thing that gets me is having to deal with people, especially as I am an introvert and work full time so I have little time to recharge. And with the holidays coming, customers are very aggressive and it triggers my fight or flight instincts. I get frustrated when people come up to me to ask a question as it is disrupting my tasks I need to get done, which I feel really bad about. It just feels like an instinct reaction to me that’s hard for me to control. In the past few weeks I think the stress has become enough for me. I’ve had multiple people threaten to call corporate about me for me simply following the rules, one of those people actually did call corporate about me and lied about the situation. I had a woman come up to me acting passive aggressive towards me. My anxiety normally shows itself as anger or frustration, which has become difficult to hide and put on a front for others to see. Got a complaint to my boss from her about me and how I didn’t say you’re welcome for showing her where something was. On top of that we have another manager who has been causing issues, as well as forcing me and others to have to alter our hours/schedule. The final straw for me was today when I got yelled at by my district manager for not completing something. I tried to hold my tears back but towards the end I couldn’t hide my shaky voice. She confronted me about it and I broke down. What really pissed me off is I know she doesn’t care about my stress, she seemed more worried that “there was now a crying manager”. It’s just a bunch of little encounters that nag at me when I try to sleep at night. They build up and I just exploded today. I already know that I want to leave this job. But I really like my store manager and I would feel bad for quitting when we’re about to hit peak season. The pay is also good and I’m trying to save money to move out. But the stress seeps into my personal life and I’m isolating myself and neglecting my life aspirations. I want to be an artist but in order to work my way there I need to be creating. But by the time I’m off work I’m exhausted mentally and physically. I’ve become pessimistic and cynical again. I feel hopeless that if I don’t make a change soon I will be stuck in customer service forever, which makes me feel suicidal. I’ve been looking for other jobs but nothing seems like it would be better. Also when I get complaints, I reflect on it for days and think about myself as a person and how people see me. I feel terrible for not being more welcoming and friendly like I used to be, but at the same time I’m angry at the customers for being rude to me. When it comes to my mental health, I was in therapy when I started the job but left in the beginning of the year because I was doing well. I decided I am going to go back to therapy to deal with my anger and stress. But now I feel my anxiety and mood swings coming back. I worry that all of the stress will trigger a depressive episode, which for me is debilitating. The stress has also triggered mania for me before. I just feel like I cannot be a manager anymore, and I want to leave the customer service industry forever. I’m just scared to do something about it. I know this post was long, but it’s been a rough month for me. I don’t want to bother my friends about my problems but I just needed a place to rant until I can get a therapy appointment. I also wanted to hear if anyone else has experienced this stress and burnout from work and how they handled it. I’ve been hysterically crying all night and I just can’t take it anymore.",1
"Chronic stress relief— PLEASE HELP! Hi, I am writing this post because I am— to be blunt— very desperate for stress relief. I am only 19, but about half of my life has been spent trying to cope with things that were abnormally stressful (in comparison to my peers). My parents getting divorced in 5th grade quickly turned into my mother being emotionally abusive, my new stepdad making my mom’s house very unsafe, and my mom taking his side and doing very out of pocket things to try to get us to pity her (pretending to be stalked, faking cancer, allegedly being “poisoned,” etc.)… Ever since this began, I had always followed an escapist route, so much so like that I developed a form of psychosis that led me to believe that this world was entirely a dream (and that I had more control over things than I actually do). I have undergone a lot of persona, mental illness related troubles as well, and it truly seems as if there is no situational stress relief. In February of 2020, however, things took a turn for the worse. Due to extenuating circumstances, I was facing an incredible amount of financial stress, and had to scrounge for money to buy dinner. I started experiencing debilitating stomach pain that doctors could not pinpoint. Quarantine followed shortly thereafter, and then I moved 2 hours away from everyone/everything in order to go to college. I had no money and no friends, and my grades began to slip. My stomach pains got worse, and then I also started to experience sleep issues that make it virtually impossible to wake up on time for work, class, etc. unless I have slept 12+ hours. I have seen so many specialists, to no avail, and these health issues simply exacerbate all of the other familial, academic, and financial burdens I am facing. I have been trying to be as patient as I can, but I have now been told that the majority of my health issues are caused by stress itself. This is a catch-22 in many ways, and this news in and of itself is a stressor. Now, I am hyper-aware of my stress, and feel like I can’t do anything without getting chest pains. I am getting a new psychiatrist and therapist, but my appointments are not for a while, but I am not functional until then! I do things to destress daily (art, talking to my family/boyfriend, etc.) but it’s clearly not enough. Any help is appreciated! Thanks! )",1

"Suicide isn't an answer"" Yes, but it seems like an option. The only real option. The only button that ends eternal pain and suffering. Fade away from everywhere and become nothingness. All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness. But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them. Yet they wouldn't take a minute to listen to one of those millions of thoughts I have ruining my head. Ironic.",1
Why shouldn't I kill my self? What will happen and how will it effect people around me if I kill my self. Of course it will make my family sad and my friends also but honestly I don't see this a sign to not kill my self. Please give some other reason why shouldn't I do it.,1
"Stressed, depressed, anxious and exhausted. I am very stressed, depressed and full of general anxiety with health anxiety and ongoing physical symptoms maybe due to stress or anxiety. I also suffer with OCD (all themes) and with intrusive thoughts. I am now fed up of all these psychological issues, physical symptoms and I am now mentally exhausted. On top financial issues due to debt, working full time (not happy with my job due to co-workers chatting whole day constantly) with additional two freelancing jobs to clear off my debts ASAP. Gym was my escape from the stress and I hardly missed a workout in a long time, because I also loved working out. Now due to Costochodrities I can’t even work out. Just keeping hopes high that eventually everything will be ok. God Bless.",1
"I feel like a soulless robot. And it's ruining my life. This is gonna be interesting trust me. I'm 22 years old. And I'm from Sri Lanka. I have some serious problems. And it's affecting my whole life. I don't have or want friends. The only person I consider as a friend outside the family is my girlfriend. Haven't talked to my mother and sister in 2 years (They live in the same house btw). I'm a workaholic and I never skip classes so I always get good grades (Parents never forced it). I just hate being the second. Always want everything to be perfect. Like when I drive my girlfriend somewhere I want the exact time and destination before the trip begins. And I get mad/panicked when there is a change like if she asks me to pull over to get snacks or something. And I always ask her to call the person she is going to meet before and tell me an exact time even though I'm free all day that day. I always map out my tasks. When there is a sudden change I panic and do something stupid. And another funny thing my girlfriend pointed out was that I always check my wallet while shopping even though I know I have more than enough in my pocket. And another thing is that I hate authority. Like in school when a teacher tells me to stop doing something I feel like he/she is taking away my creativity and freedom. Another thing is that I plan everything way too much. I have mapped out my whole career while still in college. I even have specific tasks I want to do in my 30s and 40s and I have done everything according to that plan so far. And I get really depressed when something fails. After that, I hate everyone and won't be happy again until I accomplish something good again. I just can't shake off that loss. Am I batshit crazy???? I don't consider myself arrogant but sometimes I think why do I need all this stress? I'm just a kid. But other times I feel like I'm some kind of a chosen one and I need to do everything better than others. This behaviour is starting to become a problem. And the people I love like my mother, sister and my girlfriend are getting hurt because of me. I really want to know what I can do to change this. Any help would be appreciated. I just want to be happy. Thank you in advance.",1

"During a bad period of depression/anxiety I stopped reaching out to friends, and found out that if I didn't speak first nobody would even remember I exist Since March nobody has spoken to me or invited me to do anything. I always had thoughts in the back of my head that my friends didn't like me, and I had to ""invite myself"" and they accepted because they felt sorry. My anxiety started raising like never before and since then to this day I haven't spoken with people I thought cared for me. Turned out my fears were true, feeling absolutely isolated from society and lonelier than ever. This is the lowest point of my life.",1

"Stress & Anxiety whenever I start my work shift I'm not a newbie, I've been at this company for more than three years so I know what my job is. But for the past couple of months I've been anxious at the start of my shift and as I progress (by midday) I feel stress on my right shoulder or trap. This always happens daily and I feel that I'm not the most stressed only when its my rest day. So I tend to get more done during those days compared to my normal days on shift. Hoping that folks could share insights or help me out with techniques to improve when I am on shift. Thank you.",1
"Do you ever wish you were alone I have a girlfriend of 5 years, and I feel so guilty for wasting so much of her time on me. I feel like it would have been better if I was alone so I could just end it. But now I have to keep going just to make sure she has a good life. I can deal with my eventual death, but knowing that i will have to watch all of my loved ones wither away and die, even if it's on a 25/50 year scale is too much. Every moment is a moment closer to tragedy, the easy solution would be to die young, but then I'm leaving behind my GF and I wouldn't wish that on her. I feel like that expression ""watching a car crash in slow motion"" that's life it's all just a slow painful build up to eventual tragedy. Not sure if this is very coherent, but it feels really good to put it out there.",1
"First time going for therapy and my therapist cried Recently I’ve been feeling dangerously numb again and I’m… just… very exhausted. I’ve lived 22 years feeling like I’m dead and if I don’t get help now, I will probably be dead in my 30’s. It was last Friday. I was very nervous because I felt some sort of shame for making this person listen to me talk about my childhood for 2 hours. I felt selfish. Inside I kept thinking, “okay, what should I talk about next?” and it was almost as though I was selecting a book off a shelf to read aloud to this lady opposite me. And these are books you’ve written and read countless times before and reading it one more time feels like nothing to you. But then she started crying. Before we had started, she placed a tissue box next to me and said that I might need it, but in a reversal of events, I’m the one panicking. She said that the image of child me living in constant emotional abuse and neglect for almost 18 years broke her heart. After I went home, I cried too. I’ve forgotten that I shouldn’t be used to it, and that it is okay for me to cry, to feel sorrow for the child who was once me. That I don’t have to play it off as the past, or compartmentalize my feelings, that I am still very haunted even as an adult.",1

"Sudden stutter Hi guys, I have recently started a job in December that is a lot more overwhelming than first anticipated, it's not the job description that is the problem it's the place and the boss. There is basically 3 years worth of mess for me to clean up. As a result of this I haven't been sleeping well for the last 3 months and I think its finally caught up with me this morning because I woke up the morning stumbling over my words and stuttering over others.

"If isolation is bad, why does it feel so good? Why do I feel even more inhuman when I'm with others? I don't want to talk, I don't want to smile. I don't want one of my friends to listen. I'm sick and tired of speaking, of explaining. Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy. When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them. I don't want people to occupy me or make me happy. I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way. I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want. It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something. If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine. You have to see what's wrong and adjust it. And right now, every form of human interaction feels like I'm doing a marathon with that leg...",1

"Holding a job is too hard I quit my first job recently. The reason? I have been late for two times and my manager is telling me that. Why was I late? Because I tried to do a personal leave due to period problems, but he replied me late, so I went to the job anyway. Now he forced me to sign the late paper and I know it is going to stay with me forever. I know my later employee would call the company and knew that I have been late for 2 times in a month. Lol. However, for this job, I had to work at least 9.5 hours everyday from Monday to Friday. I refused to work overtime during weekends because I cannot have no time to wash my clothes, buy groceries, or do anything to recharge myself. I dont have a nanny to take care of me. I dont want to starve to death just for the ridiculous lower 25 percentile for my profession salary. Now I am trying to land a job in my major.

"My boyfriend and I are on homecoming court!! This afternoon my boyfriend (17M) and I (17F) found out we would be on our schools homecoming court, and it felt so surreal! I had to keep looking at the announcement post over and over to make sure I wasn’t dreaming! For some context, we’re both seniors and were one of four couples most voted out of around 12+ couples! It makes me really happy, because I’m a shy, mostly introverted kid, and I have a lot of social anxiety, and it’s just really good to have a sort of…validation from my peers, you know? Although I also owe a lot of it to my boyfriend, he’s really outgoing and charming, I don’t think I could’ve ever gained the confidence to do this without him! I’m super excited for the homecoming game now, I’m determined to make my senior year the best yet! It’s funny too, we were supposed to find out who was on the court last Friday, but due to technical issues (they left one of the couples off the ballot) and ties (apparently four couples tied for second place! Isn’t that crazy?!) we had to revote today! I was anxious my entire class after voting, but it felt so good to see our names there! If you don’t mind me getting mushy, I really appreciate my boyfriend a lot and am so excited to get to do this with him. We both had really bad previous relationships, and it was something we bonded over. He treats me so well, he likes to show me off, is always loving to me, and I can tell him anything! I can’t express just how much I appreciate him, because I really do. He even bought me a froggy bucket hat that he gave me earlier today! Honestly, my day has just been really amazing, and I hope yours is too!",0

"Yesterday makes me grateful for everything I ever worked for This story may drag on a little but I have never done this and I want to talk about it to someone. I got my first car yesterday. It’s a wagon of crap, but hey, it’s MY wagon of crap. I took my girlfriend for a drive for the first time last night and I took her to a peak that looks over our town. It was pretty dark and we were driving to some quiet music and we couldn’t get the smiles off our faces if we tried to. She bought a Polaroid camera, one of those ones that print instantly and she had it with her, being all retro. She wanted to take a photo of me with the car, and she told me that I’d thank her one day. So she did and I realised I wanted one of her, just for me. I took the camera out of her hands and asked if I could get a photo of her and she let me. Boys, let me tell you, those eyes are tattooed across my memory. I got the photo and I asked if I could keep it, just for me. She said I could if I really wanted to, not realising how important she is. And now I’ve got it. And I keep that photo in my cap. I was actually debating whether to keep it in the mirror that folds up on the ceiling of the car, but I quite like having it in my hat. A photo of the two things I love. My girl and my car.",0

"HELP! Have you ever felt like this? Hi everyone, for the last few weeks I’ve been feeling very off I feel like I’m living in a dream, like almost drunk but not quite drunk. Like I’m disconnected and out of it. I feel like I’m living behind a glass, no quite “in my life” I’ve been having pressure around the back of my neck, the back of my head, (not a headache just pressure) and I sometimes feel like my eyes are being pushed too. I had blood work done, and everything seems fine, I had a negative Covid test twice, antibody test for Covid came out negative... checked for Lyme disease, heavy metals, and other common things but everything keeps coming back negative. At this point I’m wondering if this is related to anxiety/stress. In the last year, like most of us I’m sure, I’ve been dealing with lots of emotional ups and downs, I suffered from my first panicked attack las summer but things improved a bit after that so didn’t have to take any medication or continue with a therapist. My logical brain wants to tell me that symptoms like the described above are no way related to anxiety disorders or chronic stress but I’m desperate to understand what’s happening to me. Could you please share if you have ever felt this way and your experiences or knowledge?

"I think acting depressed around people was a mistake No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections. Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked. Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself. EDIT okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that. But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever.",1

"Uncontrollable Rage Trying To Learn Japanese I'm usually quite calm and able to control myself, but trying to learn Katakana through use of Anki has resulted in unbelievable rage. You may think I need to quit learning or it's not something I want to actually do, but I can assure you I do want to learn it quite a lot. The problem is I get so incredibly frustrated when I'm shuffling through the same 20 cards and none of them are sinking in. I have so many leech cards out of rotation it just upsets me. Something else about me is that I don't have the option to write them out like people would suggest. I have had bad wrists for 6 months despite doctors being unable to pinpoint the problem. I meditate every day, sometimes twice a day to keep my stress down and hopefully heal my body. What gets me is that this is the thing that stresses me so much. I don't know why this particular thing makes me want to hurt myself. Like I get so angry I have smashed the computer desk like a child. I'm not a violent person, I've never hit anyone in my life, but sometimes I'm hitting myself or hurting my hands in rage. I grip my hands so hard it starts to hurt. I start hitting myself getting upset because I'm so mad. What should I do about this? Should I stop learning Japanese?

"Why do people assume that our lives aren’t that bad as long as we’re alive? I had a conversation with my granddad yesterday and I basically told him how stressed and down I was feeling. He said I shouldn’t let anything take my joy away but I told him my joy was long gone. He then proceeded to tell me that life can’t be that bad. I felt so invalidated. It’s like as soon as you open up a little, you get slammed with how hard other people have it and how you should be grateful. I understand there are people out there that have it worse than me, but does that mean I’m not allowed to be depressed or anxious? Can I not express how I feel without someone throwing in a counterargument about another persons struggle? It’s like people assume everything is perfect as long as you’re alive. They only see what they want to see and aren’t comfortable with the ugly truth. I’m so sorry for rambling, but this really pisses me off.",1
"Today I'm finally throwing away my suicide note I've been a better state of mind this past year, but I think this is the day that I finally commit to it. I'm not going back again. I made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery, and I can do it again if I end up back where I was. I hope, if you read this and are suffering yourself, that you see this as evidence that no matter how long you've felt this way, recovery is always a possibility. Much love x",0
I am losing it and fast. Yes I am losing it. I give myself at most 6 months. I am 100% sure I won't live beyond that. The thing that is keeping me safe rn is the lockdown due to pandemic. I found a way to leave this world with 100% efficiency. I am doing it once I get back to college. My grades are dropping. I am trying my best. I am contacting the people I was rude in the past to ask for their forgiveness in the most vague way possible. I have no girlfriend or anything. If I tell my parents they are going to send me to a mental hospital or something. Ah Life. You beat me!,1

"The most stress I've had ever I'm studying for a test to get in a University, it's been really stressing me out so much that something as simple as moving around can be somewhat entertaining. But recently in a try out test I can't even finish 50% of it even tho I've studied almost all day everyday. My stress level went up so much that I started to cry (I can't even remember the last time I cried, so it's that bad) and everytime I tried to take a break I always felt guilty because I know I only have around 3 months left to study but I decided to just chill around. Excercising usually works for me but it doesn't for this. Any help?",1

"Today I've decided to elimate my biggest stress factor my daytime full-time job. I decided not to show up. I'm not going back. I worked there for 3 years and I've always felt like a soulless being once I entered the job. I was making $17 an hour at this place, 40 hours a week, $500 after tax. for now I'll be doing ubereats making $20+ an hour.. I will be my own boss and work my own time (temporarily) I know they will be pissed because I'm the only one at this place including the manager that does what I do, but when they presented me a 50 cent raise, I screamed inside. I finally broke free and I feel a little bad about my decision today, but in the long run I know my mental state will be in a better position. I can finally drive my wife to work, and drop off our daughters in school and in the afternoon pick my daughters up and then pick my wife up. This brings me joy. I know how hard it is for my wife to dress two kids in the morning, take public transportation when it's really really cold, raining, snowing outside. That's really hard. I pray everything goes well from here on.",0
"Is not sure what's happening So I'm not really here to use this as a diagnosis. This is more so for me to see if this is genuine enough to seek help, or just to generally get an idea of what's wrong. Im not sure that it can be classified as depression, but i didn't really know where else to go. Sometimes I really worry alot that maybe I'm subconsciously doing this for attention or something like that, or im just being dramatic and not knowing it. To start off though, whenever I'm feeling fine im a pretty motivated person. I really like to work out and box, its one fo my favorite things to do. I'm in college and I get pretty good grades, I love to explore and try new things. I'm a big foodie, maybe even to the point I eat way more than I should haha. However, I have periods of time where I just feel very very unhappy and unsatisfied with everything. I can usually tell when it's about to start. It begins with me kind of zoning out alot more and I'll start to have times where I question existence and everything seems kinda fake. These times kind of suck because I start to feel like everything I'm doing is pointless and I just want to drop out and leave. Then I start to get extremepy irritable. Im pretty much mad at everything and I'll even make stupid arguments with my gf and look for reasons to be angry. This is then followed by a period where im just unhappy I guess. I'm not sure if thats the right word. I'm not necessarily sad all the time, although I'm much more likely to be sad. But its mostly just I don't want to exist I guess. Like its so hard to just do anything and it kind of puts a strain on my relationship because I don't want to talk, or go anywhere, or even cuddle with my girlfriend. Everything I try to do is just unsatisfying, I can't even sit on tik tok or play games. I just want to do absolutely nothing and be alone, and it makes me genuinely so sad when my girlfriend wants me to get out of bed. During good periods the unhappiness will only last a few days. During bad times it can last a week or two. The zoning out and irritability will usually start 1-3 weeks before, depending on how bad it is. Its all a slow build up then it slowly goes away. This all happens kind of randomly. Maybe once every other month during the summer. It gets much worse during the winter. It lasts longer and is much more intense. I really just want to know if this is genuine or not. I'm really unsure sometimes.",1
"Witness to extreme violence Today I saw a 23 yo being thrown away from a moving car into the highway. I arrived a bit late to the scene while she was bleeding a bit and had a shock response where she could not stop shaking and crying. Then she told me her name and that was her husband who pushed her from the car... When the police arrived they were so violent with her, specially the oldest guy who lacked basic human empathy. He blamed her and she stopped talking and came back to cry uncontrollably. My husband and I checked for visible injuries and confort her while we could. It happened on a 5 pm Sunday while we were going for groceries and now I can't shake the memory and have no idea what to do with what I witnessed.",0

"Do you ever wonder “if I could just beat depression, I could do it all”? Depression isn’t swallowing me up anymore; it feels like it’s in the background of my world, of everything I do, of every unfinished project or stack of dirty dishes…. at work when I can’t focus on my assignments… those times I feel weighed down on the really really bad days…. I often wonder — if I could get over this shit… could I do it all? Could I actually have a career? Or will I always just feel cursed?",1

"Struggling I’ve delt with depression for alot of my life. I lost my mom to cancer a month after I turned 21 in 2010 and spent most of my 20s in a dark place never really processing it in a healthy way. Fast forward to 2017 and thats when I hit an all time low becoming suicidal and hating the fact I would wake up and see another day. That became a real turning point for me I decided I really needed to get my life in order. Over the past few years that’s exactly what I did. I quit a job i hated and got my dream job.Started chasing a hobby I have loved since I was 9 but was too scared to ever try, lost over 40pounds, got myself outta debt and started a real savings account. Everything seemed and felt like I finally got my life on track and was heading into a great direction as I turned 30. I was becoming more social and really breaking outta my shell. Then covid hit and everything started to fall apart. I lost my dad to cancer/dementia last December ten years almost to the day that I lost my mom. A month later I got covid and it took a horrible toll on me this past January. In march I found out my dream job would be shutting down in May. That job ment alot as I met alot of special people who helped me become a better person. Saying goodbye to them sent me down a bad spiral of weed and junk food where I ended up putting on 20pounds. My hobby has been on hold since covid started as its a contact activity (i was actually getting pretty good at it too precovid)Ive gone through a good chunk of my savings as I look for other work and am back in more debt then ive ever been in before. Ive found myself now not knowing where the past six weeks of my life have gone as ive just been getting high almost everyday. Im watching everyone around me living what seems to be their best lives wither its exciting new jobs, awesome vacations, new houses, getting married and so on while im laying in bed so broken and numb. I havent left the house in over two weeks as getting outta bed feels like it takes everything I have in me. I havent posted on social media in months and kinda fallen off the face of the earth what hurts most about that is that is seems and feels like no one has noticed or cares. Thankfully im not suicidal this time around as ive been before . I just feel broken and empty. Im trying my hardest now to pick myself up and get my life back on track ive given up weed gotten back into the gym and making an extra hard effort to find a job in my career field. I know we are all dealing with stuff which is why I don’t really tell anyone this as I don’t want to be a burden. Im hoping posting this here will help in some therapeutic way and I know this was a very long read so I dont expect many people to get through the whole thing but if you did thank you I know there will be better days a head i just hope they come soon. Much love to everyone who is struggling right now I hope you know you are not alone.",1

"I'm literally all alone and there's no hope for my future This is going to be extremely long so just a heads-up. I was abused from 8-14 years old when my mom married my stepdad. My mom was an amazing person and she always did whatever was best for me. She had no way of knowing that my stepdad was a horrible person because he was actually really good at hiding it by acting all sweet and kind. He would do it in secret when my mom went away on business trips and he psychologically messed me up so much that I was scared to tell my mom. Just so you know how bad it was, I'll tell you something he did. My precious pup at the time was my best friend and I'd always go to her for comfort whenever he was abusing me. He noticed how much she meant to me so he started grabbing her and beating her infront of me while I pleaded with him to stop. He killed her like that one day. He just told my mom she ran away or something. My mom started becoming suspicious and eventually found out. She divorced him and got a restraining order. The next 2 years were the happiest years of my life. I got a absolutely gorgeous girlfriend that was way out of my league and made some amazing friends. I started highschool and things were going great. Then my mom got sick. The nerves in her legs started to rapidly deteriorate or something so she couldn't walk. She lost her job and became very depressed. She unfortunately ended her own life. I broke that day. Luckily I had my girlfriend and her parents that did everything they could to make sure things were going to be ok for me since I don't have any other family. It was always just me and my mom. My grandparents died when I was 5 and my dad died when I was 2 so I never really knew him. My girlfriend's parents let me stay by them and they were willing to pay for my schooling and everything. It was hard getting over my mom's death but I was able to get through it thanks to my girlfriend. For a while things were going ok again but then my friendgroup started experimenting with drugs and my girlfriend wasn't having it so she separated me from them. It was against my will but I'm happy that she did. I didn't have any friends but my girlfriend was my best friend anyways and she was more than enough for me. Once again, things were going well for a bit until covid hit and my girlfriend's parents started struggling with money. I felt really bad since they wouldn't have struggled if it wasn't for me living with them. I started eating less and doing everything I could to save them money. Unfortunately it didn't really help. They're still struggling a bit. What I'm about to tell now is where my whole existence just shattered. My girlfriend broke up with me. I won't explain why but the reason for it was understandable and I'll never hold anything against her. Like I said before, she's way out of my league and she was the most perfect girlfriend anyone could ever dream of while I'm just an average guy that had issues because of what I've been through and all of the mess that follows me. So we broke up and now I'm all alone. I lost the only person that I had in my life and not only that but she was the one that was keeping me together. To add insult to injury, her parents suddenly just did a complete turnaround and they suddenly don't give a shit about me anymore. They want me out of their house by January next year. My ex has pleaded with them to be less cruel but I asked her to just leave it cause I don't want to be the reason for them fighting. Im only 18 and my finals are literally right around the corner. I don't have anywhere to go, im all alone without a single cent to my name and Im trying to get through a break up still. I can't begin to explain how I feel. I don't care what anyone says about ""Oh but there is help and you can get through this"" because I literally can't. My entire life has been slowly cracking and crumbling and now it's finally collapsed. I'm only 18 years old, all alone, no money, no job and soon I won't have anywhere to go. I'll be homeless. Everything is out to get me right now and there isn't anything I can do. I'm going to go and kill myself soon. The sad part is that even if I do, nobody would care. Life is fucking shit. Thanks to whoever actually read all of this. I guess I'm just hopelessly trying to leave any kind of legacy behind that I possibly can. Goodluck to everyone else that's still dealing with life and all it's bullshit.",1
"Is this a bad coping mechanism? To be short, my stress stems from other people being stressed. I myself personally have no real issues but this pandemic has made life hard for people I care about and thus causes my stress. The biggest one is a friend of mine who because of the pandemic and her health issues/weak immune system she has been unable to consistently keep a job this year. I help her as best I can; driving her to work/interviews (she has no car), lending her money which I know wont be repaid anytime soon(through no fault of hers) and has depleted my savings account. She also has depression and because of all of this has been having more and more low days. Her roommate also has depression and recently it culminated in him having a breakdown on a bad day and pulling out his gun wanting to end it all. Thankfully we called his best friend and sister and they convinced him to go to a doctor and get help but I know this just compounds my friends anxiety about being a burden on him because she herself has been unable to pay rent the past few months. (Note, he has a very good paying job and doesnt necessarily need her rent, he mostly wanted a roommate for the company but its still a source of great guilt and shame for her.) She just found out today that her seasonal job decided not to keep her on and she has to hunt for another job again and it makes me worried about her even though she seems level headed about it right now and I dont feel like she is a huge risk (right now but I know I still need to keep an eye on her and check in.) The coping mechanism(?) Perhaps this was triggered by her roommates breakdown but through part of the day I've just been running the scenario through my mind What if she does kill herself? I run it through my head how I might act, or feel, who I would call, what life might be like for me afterwards and feel the emotions of the imagined scenario wash over me even as I think about it from a practical stand-point. The reason I call this a coping mechanism(?) is because this isnt the first time I've done this. Almost everyone I know/am close to has depression and is on meds, one of these friends I drove to the hospital after HER suicide attempt a few years ago( a different friend, and I was her crutch at the time like I am for this friend). Almost all of my depressed friends I've run through the horrible scenario in my head and had the thoughts of ""what would I do? How would this effect my life physically and emotionally?"" I do my best to be available for my friend while trying to keep my own mental health in check (even though I feel guilty when I say I cant hang out with her/dont have the spoons to drive to her place as she lives 30 minutes away.), and while Im helping her financially I know I cant keep doing it but I try to help her when she needs rides or small things, but other than that theres not much else I can do to help her, its all been horrendous bad luck out of our control. I know this thought process probably isnt normal but could it just be this weird coping mechanism Im doing to try and assert some sort of control of the situation, or am I a complete sociopath for running the scenarios in my head?",1

I mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? It's exhausting and I feel mentally crippled. This has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement. What the fuck is the point?",1

"I have made the decision to give up until I kill myself I have never been happy. My parents have always put themselves over me. They don’t keep jobs, they’re addicts, and have never EVER done something for me unless it benefitted them. I remember being a 6 year old not understanding why my dad wouldn’t just give me food- why did I have to tell him my mom’s secrets or do something for him to be fed? Why couldn’t my parents just go to the store and get me advil when I am in pain? Why did I have to wait for them to run out of beer and then they might get it if they remembered? Why did I sleep on chairs because every time I asked for a mattress they were too busy? I was friends with a girl when I was very young. She passed away and my mom didn’t even take me to the funeral. I self harmed at 12 and my mom looked at me and walked away. My dad used to emotionally abuse me at the same time. One day on Christmas when there weren’t presents under the tree, I asked my mom why and she *screamed* (and I mean screamed) at like 2nd grade me about how Santa isn’t real because we were poor. And so many other things that have just chipped away at me over time I overthink to such an extreme degree I don’t think I could grow up and stay sane. I have so many thoughts that race through my head that my veins feel like they are physically heating up and I want to scratch my skin off. I’m 16. I barely mentioned anything i’ve been through and I’m 16. I say that because to me 16 is a fucking child. I AM a CHILD and I mentally feel 60. I feel like I’ve gone through so much, had to raise myself at such a young age, overthought the universe and self analyzed myself to all shit, and it all has just burned me the fuck out. I dropped out because I knew my parents wouldn’t care. I finally have reached a point where I am so tired I can’t even try to care. I don’t think I’ll ever get out of this burnout. There’s nothing to look forward to. There’s nothing that motivates me. Being a kid is the best part of life and then you grow up and work and suffer. Except all I’ve done is suffer and now I’ve given up. I don’t think, or want, to get a steady job to work for the next 40 years of my life just to benefit a corrupt fucking system. I think about the future and I don’t see one for myself. And honestly that’s what I want. If i feel this way at 16 I don’t want to grow older. I don’t want to have future plans. I want to fuck around and then kill myself because there’s truly no place in this world where I would be happy. Call me lazy and selfish but this life is so fucking stupid. We come here to suffer and work. Some get to suffer less and some get to suffer more. And why you may ask? There is no why. We’re on a rock, suffering, doing all this labor, and we don’t even know why we’re here or why we’re doing it. We follow these governments and do what they say because what else can we do? We live paycheck to paycheck with only a couple days off and then back to being a slave. I don’t really have an idea for what happens in the afterlife but I genuinely DO NOT CARE ANYMORE. I don’t. Because this life I’m living now leaves a rotten taste in my mouth and I can’t fucking stand it. That’s all.",1

"Does my depressed girlfriend realize (rather than feel) that she loves me? Hi everyone, My (31M) girlfriend (28F) of 4 years suffers from depression and she's currently going through a rough period. I have never understood depression and I have accepted that I never will so I just try to be as supportive as I can with information from places like this subreddit. However, one question that I've always had and was afraid to ask why can't she own up to it? She is currently going through tough times. These days, she does not feel love for me (or anyone else) and is completely miserable. This is something that I can accept as being depression. But why can't she just say something like ""I know that I love you, even though I don't feel it."" or ""Thank you for taking care of me, I know this must suck for you""? She could even say ""I know I don't feel grateful right now but rationally, I realize that you are amazing for taking care of me"". One small sentence like that would mean the world to me and I can't imagine that she does not realize this. I hope this post won't be interpreted the wrong way. She is struggling with something horrible and I am complaining about wanting some compliments on the internet, but some days I feel like I can't take this anymore. Thank you to anyone who reads this.

"Any tips on how to not let stress overwhelm you in the moment? So I just started graduate school this semester, which of course is adding on to the stress I already feel daily with money concerns, driving, interacting with people... lol you know, the usual problems of a highly tense person. I've been noticing more lately that I'm doing a poor job at controlling my stress. Once something goes wrong, no matter how minor the inconvenience, my brain freaks out. It's like the world is going to end if I don't find a parking spot or if I sleep in past my alarm. I've been taking my stressed induced panic/anger out on my wife and I feel horrible about it.

"Time for another round of “do I actually feel sick, or is it just psychosomatic”? I generally feel unconcerned with the Coronavirus thing - if you think you have it quarantine yourself, stay clean, but if you get it it’s not the end of the world (assuming you’re healthy and have no pre-existing conditions) just rest and get better. I tend to have little issues related to things other than illness - aches and pains from my job, nausea that happens for no real reason from time to time, anxiety from depression and stress, etc. And I would like to think that if this whole virus thing, with inconsistent symptoms it seems (health sites say one thing, individual people say “well actually”), wasn’t happening, I wouldn’t be stressing over “what if’s” as much. Are these little “it’s nothing”s actually something? Is what I’ve been wondering more. For example, I’m not constantly sneezing or have a runny nose like a cold, but I have been sneezing Just a bit more often. My throat isn’t sore, though it does get itchy or scratchy out of nowhere. And if I cough it’s to relieve the feeling in my throat, not a cough that comes from the lungs (if that makes sense). So, allergies right? But I’ve also been getting chest pain and having more issues breathing - not constantly, just out of nowhere it’ll start and stop at some point. Ok... chest pain could be stress and/or anxiety (because I have a lot of that in my life). Oh! And I’ve also been getting headaches lately, which isn’t normal for me but I had been chalking it up to stress since it came before everything else (my mom was away for a week and a half visiting a friend and I basically had to pick up some responsibilities like going to the store, driving people places, making sure regular things were done like the garbage being taken out. All things that sound easy, but are stressful and frustrating when it feels like you’re the only one doing it). So stress causing the chest pain and headaches. And I figured that allergies could be causing the trouble breathing. It’s happened before. Usually in the spring (I’m not sure what I’m allergic to but it’s definitely something in the air during the warmer weather). And it Has been starting to get warmer... Plus, as far as I know, I haven’t had a fever. (I have been getting the chills lately, but that’s also common when I’m overtired, which can be from stress) But then there’s the doubts. Especially after I hear that the symptoms aren’t Definitely [this, this, and this]. Like one of the things emphasized is the difficulty breathing - but I’ve seen a post from one confirmed case that said they only had that symptom when they tried to smoke (so under certain circumstances). I also thought you had to have cold-like symptoms but apparently not? This virus is one that you apparently need a BINGO chart to mark your symptoms. And so I’m just conflicted. Am I just plagued by stress causing me to have mild, explained-away “symptoms”? Or is there a chance that it’s really something? I’m not worried about dying if I do have it. I ordered some pure vitamin C though, at the behest of my one sister (very holistic, linked me to a site where I can get it without anything else added in - RevitalizeWellness.org if anyone is interested) she says it treats it or something and gave me a dosage chart. I’m just very tired of this whole situation I guess. My other sister is pretty convinced she has it and has stayed home from work the last 2 days; she said she doesn’t feel well, and while I’m not sure that hers isn’t also mental since she’s been freaking out since the start... not my life woman_shrugging_light_skin_tone And since I’m in regular contact with her because we live in the same house, well, it also adds to that “what if” mentality. What if? Anyone else feel similar or am I just crazy and overly stressed?",1

"Who else envies people without depression? I wish I wasn't born with this de habilitating disease. I find it hard just to wake up and do more than the bare minimum needed to survive. Anyone else wish they could just have the motivation to do things without thinking twice about it? For instance, I got promoted at work but it's so hard doing the homework needed for me to gain the knowledge to do this position. Other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me. And when I try to do it it's just brings so much psychological pain that it makes me feel physically ill so I go off and do leisurely things. Anyone have any tips to combat this?",1
"This may be one of the best days of my life Just a normal day of doing house chores, teaching my nephew, driving my sister to work.. And when I got home, I received an email. For nearly a year, I've been waiting for this internship in an aviation company. Due to covid, my internship got postponed. I thought they ignored my application or whatever.. But today, I received an email saying I'm gonna start my internship next week!!! I jumped out of joy and excitement first thing when I read it I'm just so happy!!!! Thinking about chances/coincidences, this is the perfect time to get out of my house because I recently got vaccinated. And thinking about the stuff I did during the pandemic, I learned a lot about myself and about the things I thought I'd never like, and I got to help (a lot) in our house, especially helping my nephew who has autism. I remembered the times when I had breakdowns, pandemic anxiety creeping in. Asking myself why are these bad things happening to me. I encountered a lot of problems especially with my family, but thing got better and I did (still do) my best to understand things from their point of view. Looking back, I was a person made out of worry. I worried and overthought everything, which led me to anxiety and breakdowns. With the help of the people around me, especially my boyfriend who's my number 1 supporter, I learned a lot about prioritizing better things in my life and not worrying too much. And this day is a very good example of the quote in the picture. ",0

"I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life. First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge) In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better). After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together. He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94). In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently). About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either. I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running. I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly. I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill. Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all. In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren. I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. Conclusion So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). EDIT First of all, thank you all! You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! Of course, I will also seek professional help. It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! I know I can't change my past but I can change my future! My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one. Thanks again you are great!

"I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore. I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless. EDIT thank you for gold, hopefully our shared experiences can help our fellow brothers, sisters, and siblings get through these hard times",1

"30, doing okay on paper but very unhappy with career and life path. Maybe depression is your body telling you something needs to change? I wish I knew what to do to make myself content. I feel like I’m stuck inside myself. Like I’ve been put in charge of taking care of and making sure this vessel/self is content but all I seem to do is fuck it all up. I can’t even figure out what I “should” be doing, if I did I could at least move in a direction, any direction. Instead I’m always sitting between 70 fucking cross roads not knowing what to do. The problem is me. Or is it modern life? I don’t even know. I hate the career path I’m in(finance) but the fucking problem I don’t even know what else I should be doing. I’ve been thinking about what to do for 5 years. I’ve considered every outcome and I still don’t know what to do. I don’t know myself well. I never took any risks in life and just took the sure path. Now I eek out a decent but not significant income but feel so so unhappy with my life direction. It’s about the way my life is, something is wrong and I need to fix it. I don’t know how to be content. I took antidepressants but all they did was turn me into a zombie and I felt off. The side effects were terrible. The entire mental health industry is a sham. It’s not for people who have any deeper or philosophical problem with life. I’m no longer interested in playing test lab rat with my brain chemistry, just guessing which random drugs I should take.

My brother is using his disability against us My brother is 17 and when he gets too stressed his legs can go out. But over time he has learned to use that against us. He will play on his PS4 all day long and then tell us that he can't do anything because his legs are out. He has caused my mom to owe the electric company 1000 dollars because she can't keep up with every month having to pay 200-300 dollars! We told him to stop playing so much but as soon as we go to sleep he's playing from 11pm-3 am even if he already played for 8 hours that day. We take the game away and he starts yelling at us about how good we are to take the only thing that can calm him down. We have tried to tell him to get out but he says he has nothing to do. We give him options and he doesn't want to do it. We tell him about all the times he stayed on for hours with a fan/heater and laptop all on and he starts arguing about the few days he actually didn't play at all! What is the best way to get it into his head that just because hes mad or can't move his legs that doesn't mean it's ok for him to waste so much electricity?,0
"Annus Horribilus Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth. She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se. In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me. During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time. I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together. When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life. My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral. I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year. I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",1

"feeling stressed and anxious about life, and it really hurts. I'm a 19-year-old girl, a senior in college. and my existential crisis is getting worse. as a kid, I've been traumatized by death. I remember clearly the day I learned what it was. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old in a museum (my dad loves visiting them), and I always hated going there because it was very silent, and spacious giving me the feeling that I had swallowed a bowling ball with a million knots in my stomach. The statues looked so real to me, I thought they were real people staring at us. One of the statues was very intriguing, it was a woman on a bed being surrounded by angels. I asked my mom what it meant? She answered saying it's most likely she's dead and the angles help her ascend to heaven. And of course, I asked what's death? And she said it's when you leave this world, someday, and you go to heaven or hell. This freaked the hell out of me for so many years. Mom told me that no one knows when we'll day, it could happen anytime. This made of fear the future. This nothingness that is death is terrifying, to me, even heaven seem scary. Like I always imagine it as a boring white place with nothing going on. I'm more of agnostic, very confused about everything. I got into counseling to deal with the stress of the uncertain rather than my existential crisis. It got better and try my hardest to be excited for the future because there's so much that I want to do and achieve. But now, it's coming back and making me feel like absolute shit. Because I'm realizing that I'm no longer a kid, I'm an adult, being taken away from those days. I really scared of dying, absolutely terrified. Everything I do now seems meaningless, the things I love like makeup and taking care of myself. I always feel guilty if I waste my time being on the internet, but then if I not doing that I would be reading a book and even that seems unnecessary. I'm afraid of turning old, afraid of the future. On top of that, global warming is making life more anxious. I don't want to live at a time where the world might end in such a terrifying way. I'm making my best to help the environment. But many don't take that seriously. I'm also afraid of wasting my youth away. I have strict parents, so I don't get to go out with my friends, do things alone, and I've never experienced love. I know women who are now in their late 30's stuck at their parent's house being sad. I don't want that. I want to move out when I have a job, live in another country. But with parents like mine (strict muslim household) they'll refuse. And I'm so scared of doing that, that I won't be happy, filled with guilt, or that it wouldn't work out. Plus, my parents, I really love them, don't want to leave them. But if I stay with them, I won't be able to live my life to the fullest. So I'm in a dilemma. I have to make a decision somehow, because time is running, and must not spend my time chickening out. But I'm in a dilemma. My head is a mess. I feel very hopeless, miserable and anxious. I feel very lonely, would love to be hugged and loved. My faculty happens to be only female, I don't feel that connected to them. And the only friends that I have are far from me, one is on another continent, and the other isn't in my faculty, very busy with work. Where I am isn't great, it's a country with many issues, and I'm the only foreigner in my uni. The place is quite dangerous, you can't go anywhere without a car and we don't have that. So I'm stuck at home with my thoughts to fuck me all over. I really miss Europe, that's where I grew up. Really hope to move out to somewhere great. I just want to be free and happy.",1
"Being feminine in male body So today i was playing games with random people, and you know sometime toxic is unavoidable. And this the first time i got this comment after long time i never hear it they call me with the most word that i try to forget because bad memory, ""sissy"" (Is in another languange) . Suddenly i got triggered and bring back childhood trauma in my head. They dont even know me and i became paranoid. Then i start shivering , shakin, and scared. The braveness that i've been building this time, suddenly its more like mask and it shattered. I feel i back to my old self. Here how trauma build in my life When i was elementary school, i was so dumb, no one even wants to friend with me and if they do , they will use me. But the most mockery that they call me was because i'm act like girl. They have some nickname for bullied me and its really hard my feelin i don't want even type it even if its not mean at all but there bad meaning there. All boys were afraid or disgusted to have same chair as me eventho i wasn't even gay before but still. The girl didn't bother to help me they sometime involved to mock me with that nickname, but i don't want everyone even girls to hate me so i laugh it off to make them happy. It was 6 year of painfullness with everyone in school (not teacher) call me that nickname. They sure not punch me in the face or something like that, but they punch me with their bad mouthing like ""u already act like girl, why you make it worse with ur stupidity"". The other example, everyone didn't believe what i said or what i hear, they think i'm so stupid even if i do something smart or maybe the ""man stuff"" Its impossible because its unmatched with my image. And sometimes all of this is still haunting me like today. My parents are no helping even my siblings. My dad and brother its really boomer and really homopobhic sometimes if i act like girl too much they will offend me with act like queer on tv with intentions it looks like me and please stop act like girl. I just can cry because i have no strength even tho i was have courage to fight my pride, i always lose to my brother strengthness and end up scared to all boys. So yeah even family, i can't trust them too So after elementary school of hell. I try to hide my feminism as much as i can (but kinda fail sometimes, but its not too feminime like myself in elementary) so everyone don't bother to bully me anymore. But i became lonely because i'm not really myself and i even forget how i was. Now im afraid to believe in people and have tho everyone is hate me, and im not important in every event which makes me hate myself to look at mirror or took photo and video, i try to avoid all of it as much as i can so i don't feel shitty and disgusted to myself anymore. To make me happy if i have a little energy left sometimes every time im about to sleep, i use my imagination if i have trusted two best friends and have big confident to be who i am and many imagination to make me look stronger.

"My friend is being released from the psychiatric hospital tomorrow! Almost a month ago, an old friend of mine went through a suicidal breakdown and he called me out of the blue for help after two years of no contact. His family is Hmong and they have very traditional gender roles. He didn’t know who else to talk to, so he just called me. He used to be my best friend in junior college and when he told me everything that was going on, I drove four hours from where I was in the middle of the night to come get him and take him to the ER and his family. This happened the day before my partner and I broke up and she was in a psychiatric hospital herself. My dad was also having some issues with his heart and I had been dealing with my own issues. It was an absurdly tough period. The last time I had seen him in person, something very similar to this had happened and he hadn’t spoke to me once since then until this particular night except to ask for a job reference. The last time he’d been on the edge, I had told him he could always ask me for help and I’d always be there for him. In the moment of as he explained what was going on, it was all I could think about and I decided I was going to do my best to honor that commitment. He ended up being admitted to a local hospital and I’ve stayed in contact with him since. We’ve caught up on a lot and he explained why he cut contact the way he did. The reasons are understandable and things got pretty emotional when he apologized. Thing is, this was my dude when we were in school and no matter how much our friendship ending hurt when it did, being human is an imperfect experience. We fuck up, we make mistakes. I’ve made so many in my life, more than I can count. I’ve come to believe it’s not making mistakes that matters, it’s how you respond and react to them. Resentment and hate are also such chaining and corrupting emotions. There’s so much freedom in forgiveness and I know all too well what it’s like to feel alone. Finally, he is being released tomorrow! I am so freaking excited for him! I am so glad he is still here on this spinning rock, I am so happy he is going to be okay. I’m flying down from Washington later today to spend some time with him. I’ve been living through the most insane periods of my life and this one of the silver linings of it all. More than anything, I’m just glad that when he called, as piss poor as the timing was, that I was able to just help and that I have my friend back again. So often I’m on the road for work and I would’ve been too far away to really be of any assistance. I don’t know how I would’ve responded had something else had happened. I’ve seen too many people in my life for young in the past few years.",0
"I hate that depression can just “sleep” for a while and then come back up full force. I was doing well until last week when I started sleeping 12 hours again, not eating then over-eating, feeling exhausted at the idea of a shower, crying, being irritable, all of the textbook signals of depression. I’m pushing my partner away and isolating again. I’ve been suddenly reminded depression never goes away, it just lays dormant until it decides to come back, at least in my case. I get my hopes up that I’ve “figured it out,” and am brutally reminded that I haven’t and never will. I’m just tired & very, very sad. I’m sorry for complaining. Edit WOW, I did not expect this many people to resonate so strongly with this. Thank you to all who have contributed to the discussion. )",1
"My bed is my safe place I know this is the clearest sign of depression, but I love staying in my bed. Even when im not tired I feel tired.

As a result I'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why Im in bed now. ",1

I keep covering for others' refusal to do their own work and I can't continue to do that. ",1
"Mom only takes my depression seriously when I mention suicide. 99% of the time when I don’t mention suicide? It’s just a phase and I need a “reality check”. Thanks mom. Edit I see some of the comments thinking I’m a teenager going through a “phase” and I’d like to clarify that I’m 24 and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I have a therapist, am on antidepressants and my mom is a narcissist. Even with the help I have, it gets hard at times and I vent. Thank you for the well wishes, everyone. I hope we can get through this together.",1
"I don’t know how I’m going to get through 8+ months of school, like I genuinely don’t know how I’m going to handle it. I’m going into my third year of high school, and every single year I go through the same cycle of becoming pretty depressed during the school year, and then being fine during the summer. This year, it’s hitting so fucking hard. Like we’re only 3 weeks in, and I’m already skipping school and waking up every morning thinking “I don’t know how I’m going to make it through today” It’s not the schoolwork really, I’m able to get homework done and get good grades, it’s the people. I hate all of them. There’s a few good eggs in there, but almost all of them are useless annoying narcissistic pieces of shit. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so depressed so early into the school year. I can handle the work, but I’m not sure if I can make it through 8 months surrounded by these awful people. I feel so lost.",1

"Today on the way to work I thought about how nice it would if someone would crash in to me or non fatally shoot me just so I'd get the day off work I struggle everyday with waking up & going to work. There are days where I have a text typed out to my boss and i just sit there and stare at for a minute before i delete it and go back in to drone mode. I don't dislike the people. I used to enjoy the type of work I do. But we're essentially mandated to work. I feel like we're all living in survival mode trying to make bank. We're destroying ourselves. For what? Unless I'm lucky I have to give 40 some odd years of my life to our labor force. Then, I'll be lucky if I get 10 years to enjoy when I'm old, frail and probably riddled with medical issues. A different job won't help, extended time off hasn't helped. Work itself is just slowly draining my life force. 10 years has taken it's toll on me and I can't see myself doing another 10 to 30. I was fired last year & took some time off before finding a new job. My mental health improved. I started to do things again. I enjoyed waking up every morning, I even enjoyed going to bed! I ate healthier. I unintentionally lost some weight. I still had issues but things were so much better. Now that I'm working again, i've stopped taking good care of myself again. I hate waking up every morning. I'm filled with anxiety. I eat foods that make me ill. I'm ignoring family and friends again. Things are going right back to where they were. I hate life. You can't just stop working because you can't just stop paying bills. Every single morning I start my day with back pain because I can't mentally get myself to get a new mattress. I don't clean, except my body and clothes before work. I stop brushing my teeth every day. I feel like a need to power cycle my brain. I'm becoming something I don't want, that I don't like and I feel like I'm not in control. I feel like I'm the verge of a mental breakdown almost every day. The wrong words or tone of voice could set me off. I get angered by something as simple as a phone notification. I have this constant feeling of doom that won't go away. I'm so exhausted. ",1

I'm so useless and do nothing all day. Im 32 male living In liverpool and so unbelievabley useless. I sit at home all day have no friends. I moved to a place where I don't know anyone. I do nothing all day long apart from going to the gym. I only go to the gym because I'm a lazy fuck and give my self some pain and suffering for how useless I am. I'm unemployed because I have mental issues where I don't give a damm if I die or not and a risk from losing it everyday and wouldn't turn up to work if Im not feeling good. I try to date but can only blag it for so long till my real self comes out that I'm nothing and not worth being in a relationship with. Im to much of a coward to commit suicide but hate living. The more I try to self improve the more I end up not caring about anything. I don't trust people and people waste my time always. I tried to believe in God went to church quite a lot but feel like it's for delousonal people. And not one thing changed within myself. I'm just sitting here watching shit on Netflix wasting my time knowing I'm a waste of space and oxygen hoping I die of a heart attack. 33 years of depression since I was born. Everyone says your life will work out you'll be happy in the future. And time has been ticking on and passing nothing has changed. Welcome to a life of depression. And thanks to some incompetent waste of space of a man and women for not wrapping up before fornicating like animals.,1
"The worst thing isn't being alone, it's being surrounded by people and them making you feel alone.

Two days ago I texted cousins, friends, and co workers and everyone said they were busy. or just plain didn't reply. I shouldn't take this personally, they are probably busy with stuff, but ever since I graduated its like I've done nothing with my life and feel like I'm not interesting enough to hang out with. I use to have a someone once who I did could always count on and hang out with, but they cut me out of their life completely and I just feel like like such a loser. ",1
"Recently told I may have mild depression…feeling kind of horrible about it I’ve been seeing a therapist for anxiety and she recently told me that I may also have mild depression; I told her basically that various aspects of my life sometime seem too hard for me to do and I just think about how it would be easier if I wasn’t here, but that I would never act on these thoughts because that would be horrible for my family. That’s when she told me I may have mild depression, which really shocked and saddened me because I had never thought I had depression. I had the wrong impression that depression across the board meant it was hard for you to get daily tasks done, which hasn’t been true for me in terms of school. I had completed everything on time, received high marks, and worked extremely hard on my projects. Same goes with my internship. But now school and my internship are over and I feel lost, hopeless, and like time is running out for me to do something successful with my life. Every job app I read seems daunting, exhausting, and soul-sucking. I tell myself I just can’t do it, and I feel so horrible about it. I have recently graduated and should feel proud and accomplished, and while I know that I did well, I don’t see anything impressive about it. I just feel like a failure kind of because the next steps are hard to initiate. I’m pretty sure I have dysthymia and may talk more about this with my therapist; I’ve definitely had these hopeless feelings for more than 2 years. I’m afraid to tell my mom about this because I don’t want her to be concerned. But my therapist thinks putting me on an antidepressant/anxiety meds will help me push through some things, and I need to tell my mom this in order to get help as I’m still on her insurance. Telling her would probably explain myself to her better. I just feel kind of lost and never thought this would happen to me. EDIT I’m also hesitant to tell my mom about this because she’s going thru something pretty stressful that concerns my sister rn, and my mom had a panic attack about it last night. I feel so stuck and will not be able to see my therapist for another 3 weeks",1

So i joined the gun group and the exercises and drills were easy to learn but hard to do. I messaged my IC and he said i could leave and he doesn’t blame us because of the injuries he had also faced. I then left and felt like an outcast even tho my fellow members said its ok. So what i am asking is that if any of you guys can help me cope with my stress.",1
Does it ever end I’m depressed all the time but these past 4 days have been so fucking unbearable I can’t stop thinking about how much I hate my life I thought that it would be more manageable soon like oh I feel extremely bad now but very soon it’ll be less worse but no I still have no interest in anything and the one person I actually want to see I rarely now get to see,1

I know it’s bad, suicide thoughts, and negativity but it feels like the realest feeling than being happy. But it’s dangerous territory I know but…idk if I make sense. When I’m happy I can feel a mini me trapped deep inside a cage wrapped in chains crying but I ignore it. It feels like a second person…idk lol",1

I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

"Depression = Losing intelligence The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey. I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions. EDIT This blew up over night, I'm thankful for the lively discussion in the comments, thanks for the awards. May you all find a way to get rid of this. Lots of love.",1
"Freaked out about school I'm a freshman in high school. Through out my school years, elementary, middle school, I just had to coast through school with no problems, I received great grades. I was never challenged and I was fine with that. I did advanced math in middle school and did fine. Last spring when online school started, everything fell apart, I skipped assignments, I didn't turn work in and when my parents got an email from my teachers, I was grounded and it made me more stressed out. But the email and punishment didn't do anything, I was still skipping. I somehow managed to pass last year with the pass/fail system they implemented last year. I thought this year would be different I would get shit handled, but since day one, can't concentrate during zooms, turning in half of the assignments and I have 3 classes I have As in and 3 that I have a C- D+ and an F in. Parent teacher conferences are tomorrow, and I am freaking out. I think I have no choice but to tell my parents before the conference so it comes from me and not them. I am fucking up so badly though in these classes. Just procrastinating work and unlike previous grades they don't chase you down if you don't have it. My parents are pretty strict. They are going to be out of their minds pissed. And I don't think I can handle it, I've never had to do this where I've had to reach out and ask for help. I'm just so terrified of telling my parents I'm repeating my same mistakes. Please can someone talk to me? Just 15 minutes or so just PM me if you can thank you",1
"Struggling to not breakdown Update* Id like to thank everyone for the kind love and support and good advice ive gotten. Things have been getting , if not better ,but more manageable. My work has managed to hire more staff and while our influx of orders keeps going up it helps to have the extra staff around. Family stuff has been managed for the most part and while I'm still vehicleless I'm making moves to get that taken care of. So in short, the stress has still been severe but not in the same way that it was before. *update end* Ever since the stay at home orders in my state happened (I'm from Oklahoma) and my mental health has kinda been all over the place. I work in a grocery store as an online shopper and as you could guess our workload has exploded from getting 20 - 30 orders a day to nearly 70 - 80 orders a day. With our limited supplies , limited trained staff and limited equipment to shop orders I've been struggling to stay put together at work. At home things are rougher. I live with my dad , his fiancee, her son and my younger brother. This past week my step-brother was attacked by his dog and had to go the ER for medical help. My grandfather, who lives in California , had to have emergency gallbladder and intestinal surgery this past week and on top of everything else my car was hit by a drunk driver and now I only have a few days to try and find a new vehicle before I gave to go back to work. I work Sat - wed so ive been holding it together through the work week but every Thursday since march ive been stuck in bed nearly bawling my eyes out about everything thats happening. Its just feels like too much .",1
Stressed to the Max Just looking for a place to let off. My stress levels is over flowing. The last two months has more stress than in the last few years. My Mother died last month. My Aunt dies two weeks ago. I work on a construction site as the only safety guy for 170+ workers. This COVID shit has caused me to not see my mother or aunt. My Father sits alone in his house in a different city. I am constantly dealing with positive cases of COVID putting myself and my family at risk. My wife has COPD and am pretty sure if she gets it it wont turn out well. Monday a small breakout of COVID happen and today a much larger outbreak happens. I have had to shut my door and lock it to stop all of the complaints. I am sure we are doing everything we can to help prevent the spread but it is starting to get to me. I don't want to be here but I have to be. I am so tired of all the anti mask issues from people. I just want it all to go away but it will not. Christmas is not looking very well,1

"School Stress Hello everyone! I’m currently in my last year of high school and I’m having a hard time dealing with it. I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you’ve gained since grade 1. Two exams are mandatory - one in literature and the other one, you can choose the subject yourself. For my second one I chose physics and I’m pretty confident with that. However, literature has always been a huge burden on mine and I find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam. I am beyond angered constantly that I have to deal with that subject - I do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments, but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and I can’t do anything but hate the guts out of it. Now, me being the perfect student, raised by perfectionist parents, I can’t even think about having low grades on that exam. I study in a “highly respected” school, where teachers can be pure evil to you. I also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine, which stress me out even more. At the end of the day, I feel so drained out and like I’ve achieved nothing, even though I have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams. I’ve started feeling physically unwell. I used to work out a lot but now I don’t have the energy to go out of my bed. My blood pressure is very low and I’ve gained weight. I’ve given up to emotional eating one too many times. I wanna shine for prom. I want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me. But I’m scared that school will drain me out too much. This is more of a rant post because I know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more. I just can’t let myself rest. My mind is constantly busy with my work. Anyways, any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated. If you made it that far, thank you for taking the time to read about my problems. ",1
"Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I? I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do. ",1
"The holidays are super stressful and at times depressing during a good year let alone 2020. I've added a few tips which help me make the most of the season, hope this perspective helps! For me, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negative/toxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones. It also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that I have... without comparing what I had or what I did to celebrate the holidays last year - this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond. For instance, I can't travel to be with my family this year so I will do a Zoom call... which is lame and depressing in comparison. So to help make it interesting I'll make the Zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam, (jackbox, quiplash, etc.) and putting the screen on my family room tv so I feel like they're with me instead of on my cell phone screen. It's not about which is better, being with them in person or on a webinar, but making the most of my circumstance and adapting... finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation... and going one step further and being grateful for it! Many people will not even have the opportunity to have a zoom call with their family, I will. This is a BLESSING. Anywho, I just released a new video on YT sharing ten tips to help us all make the most of this holiday season. These tips will also help us just feel better by eliminating some stress and anxiety and help decrease the loneliness and depression. I'm wishing you all a very peaceful and joyous holiday season! DM me if you'd like the video link too;)",1
"No matter what I do, it'll never be enough for me. No matter how much time I spend with the family I have left I'm still depressed. No matter how many friends I'll make I'll still be depressed. Even a loving relationship still doesn't distract me from the pain. And I thought that was working but all I felt was nothing. In the end I still cry every goddamn day, at this time alone with my thoughts and insecurities. I hate this life. I hate how I was born in such a horrible position. You know life would actually be a lot easier if my abusers weren't fucking immediate family members? But what's the point of pitying myself. And what's the point of being hard on myself either. I worked so hard only for a memory to kill the reality I had built for myself. I've dated so many people, and for what? To be sexually abused just like my mother did to me, just like my brother did to me. It doesn't matter if he remember or thought it's wrong at the time. He'll be dead like her. I'll still resent him like I still do with her. I always wonder what life is like in other parts of the world, what life being in a cabin is like, isolated from the world, or being in arranged marriage, different cultures and rituals, the primitive life. Those kinds of lives aren't simple, but nothing actually is. It's just different ways of surviving, different ways of thinking. But the complexity of it all is still the same. And this life isn't any different. Where I have expectations to keep up with the suburban life, have children, get married and get a good job so I can keep the house. And it sounds so easy but it's the hardest challenges. I don't have a job, I don't even know how to ride a bike, let alone a car. I don't normally admit this, but I feel like Amberlynn Reid. I live pretty much like her. And I'm so ashamed of it. I eat food, do nothing but listen to music, and maybe, just maybe, play video games. And it sucks that I'm so pretty but I have such poor health. I have hit rock bottom in life. But I guess, starting now, while I'm still alive, I won't live like this. What's the point of living in a life I never dreamed of being in? I never wanted the American dream life, did I? In the end, it's an American nightmare for me. Never live like this. Never again. Even though my life was so luxurious, and even though I'm both mentally and physically weak, and I'll be uncomfortable for a lot of it, I won't let me kill myself.",1

I know I shouldn't have been doing that but that's honestly not important to me right now, sorry. While grabbing the jar of gummies, I found a note right next to it. The note reads as a letter that my mom wrote to her mom (who passed away about 15 years ago). the TLDR of the letter is that my mom wished she knew the things she knows now as a parent when she was younger because she never appreciated how hard her mom worked for her. She went into how she thinks she failed me because of my depression (I'm open with my depression to my mom and she is supportive) and that being a parent is hard but she's trying her best but her best isn't enough. My mom has never spoken to me about her depression, although she has mentioned it very briefly, but reading that letter broke me harder than anything I can remember. I just started bawling, still am while writing this. My mom is the most important thing to me in the world and learning that she thinks she is a failure makes me have suicidal thoughts because of how broken I feel about this. But now I feel the pressure of making my mom proud and making sure she feels like she isn't a failure, so obviously suicide is off the table, at least until after she passes. I just don't know if I have it in me to turn things around, my depression has been the same ever since I was diagnosed with it in HS (I'm 26 now). I'm going to try to go out of my way and hug her more and tell her I love her and how much I appreciate her but I don't think I'll ever get over knowing how she really feels about herself. Thanks for reading. I needed to vent.",1
Head pressure? Does anyone experience somewhat transient head pressure as a result of high periods of stress?,1
Just had ice cream for the first time since seeing a dentist after a decade of being too scared to go And it was great! And I’m not crying in pain!,0
"Trying to relax is stressing me out TL/DR at bottom. So, I know this isn't nearly as serious as some people on this sub reddit, and I don't want to detract from those that really need help, but I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this. I'm on vacation, first time in about a year that I have had several days designated to relax, but I feel like I have so much on my plate that I can't relax. Work has been extremely stressful, and I have been going the extra mile to make sure that things get done correctly there. I feel like I'm sorry far behind at work that I might pass myself trying to catch up. My wife an I have also trying to get the house ready for the largest family gathering we have ever had at our house. Finishing up a complete remodel and there are a bunch of little things that need to be done so that I feel people aren't judging me. With all that being said, now that I'm here it feels more stressful to try to force myself to relax than it would be to just keep working and try to get caught up. If I had the option of an invisibility cloak, I would take off of work, then go in so I can get caught up without anyone bothering me and pulling me away from the task at hand. I don't know if these feelings are genetic or learned, but I have heard my dad say essentially the same thing in past. I am on meds for anxiety. Has anyone else ever experienced this? TL/DR I feel stressed that I'm on vacation and not working. Maybe even a touch guilty.",1
What is your comfort food Just a fan question for you guys. My comfort food is ice cream cause it makes my brain relax for a minute. What about yours?,0
"Im starting to be forgetful and Im only 24. Im starting to forget all sorts of things, the latest being I put my glasses on their case and put the case in my bag. Two days pass and I opened the case on my bad and the glasses are not there. Other cases are forgeting I had appointments for school , forgeting where I put my things , forgetting things I just read. The only place I can talk is here. So here I am leting this out of my chest. Thanks whoever reads it",1
"My life is a mess and I don’t think it’d be worth the time to clean it up I’m new to this subreddit and thought that this would be a good place get a couple of things off of my shoulders and just share my story so far. I apologize for the lengthy post. My depression started late in my sixth grade year. It began with subtle thoughts of self harm and lengthy sessions of negative thinking. By the end of the school year my family moved to the out skirts of a small town bordering the state of Washington. Once we settled in my mother forced me to ride out the last few weeks of school. My first day at the new school felt unwelcoming. Most people generally ignored me and the few that didn’t were very manipulative, using the fact that I was new to bolster their reputation. By the time that summer vacation rolled around my only friend invited me to stay at his house for the majority of the break. Most of the things that plagued my mind faded into obscurity only coming back during long nights. Nearing the end of my stay my friend decided to show me his grandfather’s stash of firearms with the supervision of his grandfather. Later that night I had developed a plan to use one of the guns to end it all but never came to fruition due to leaving the next day. The rest of the summer flew by, leading into the next school year. I was still relatively new to the school so I was still in the same circumstances I was last year. A new element that was introduced was a lack of interest and work ethic which lead to my grades plummeting. Late November I was met with extreme fatigue that would last throughout the day resulting in me sleeping through the majority of my classes, this would continue to the next school year. I still hadn’t made any friends, only interacting with others when I had to. During lunch breaks I usually sat alone, sometimes being bothered by groups of the popular kids to get me to say something to satisfy their curiosity and boredom or a concerned teacher or staff member. The end of the year my grades hung around failing and barely passing resulting in me going to summer school. This summer was uneventful besides summer school. My friend didn’t make any attempts to reach out to talk to me so I just laid around stewing in my thoughts in the isolation of my room. 8th grade was like 7th grade only differing slightly. My period of isolation during the summer had left stricken with disturbing thoughts, paranoia, and anxiety. During group activities I struggled with speaking to others, finding myself stammering when trying to speak at a normal rate and spoke quietly. I became embarrassed and would intentionally push myself away from projects. Later in the year one of the annoying kids became excessively irritating and decided to wake me as I slept during science class. I broke my silence and started to berate him. This left a lasting impression with some of my classmates. After that day I started to focus on my anger. As time went on our fights became long winded and increasingly aggressive. Not long after, I got physical with him after he had confronted me outside of class. He said something that I took offense to so I grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed him against the lockers. After that event he gradually stopped speaking around me and skipped the last day once he had heard that I was going to fight him. The summer was the same as last year. Summer school was as helpful as ever and my only friend not making any attempts to speak with me. I again left to my thoughts of constant anger and depression. My freshman year began slightly different. I had developed a friendship with a girl that rode the bus with me. She was also dealing with depression due to her abusive and controlling mother. My depression dramatically increased in late November when I developed a crush on a girl from my neighborhood. I became self destructive, insulting my appearance and intelligence. I came home in a bad mood all the time either in a blinding rage or in tears. I convinced myself that I wasn’t good enough for her and that nobody cared about me, that I was worthless. A week before Christmas break I had come up with a new plan to kill myself. The last week before Christmas break was unbearable. The thought of suicide weighed heavily on my mind. Thoughts constantly screaming at me throughout the day. The last day before break during first period I broke down in tears. I went to my councilor and confessed that I was going to kill myself after Christmas Day. I was then taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with depression. I the spent about a week and a half in the hospital and was released early due to good behavior, some acting, good attendance to activities, and the fact that Christmas was coming. I left being prescribed Zoloft and felt relatively normal for once in a long while. Christmas break came to an end not long after and school felt very much different. In mid to late January I began getting migraines from taking Zoloft and was shortly changed to fluoxetine. Not long after I then started to prepare for Valentine’s Day. A couple of days before Valentine’s Day my friend and I went to get some flowers for my crush. I had made plans with my crush to meet up but she missed it and rearranged for the 17th. We met up that night and I confessed my feelings to her to the best of my ability. She told me that she didn’t feel the same way and friend zoned me, we haven’t spoken since. I broke down in tears later that night, spiraling back down into my depression. I would find out sometime later that she never had any feelings for me and was already in a relationship before my confession. Covid would soon come around to cut the school year short and brought a new wave of anxiety and fear on top of my failed attempt at a relationship. Around mid May I stopped taking my medication thinking that I didn’t need it any longer. June through August made a great amount of progress on myself. I began the next school year happier than the last and put effort into my work. This would last until November. I quickly fell back into my old habits, constantly degrading myself. In late November I found out how my sisters truly felt about me. They felt nothing but hate for me, doing nothing but insult my appearance and intelligence and the fact that had no friends to their knowledge. In December my fights with my sister got worse and now my mother started to side with my sisters and said that I’ve changed for the worst, that I wasn’t her son, wishing for the “old me” to come back. She than grounded me and took all of my possessions. She would threaten me with the hospital and would threaten to call the cops if I didn’t comply. This would continue throughout January and end in early February. After that happened I began looking for friends so i had someone to relate to. By March I had found a couple of people that gave me purpose to live again. They helped me find a job and gave me someone to talk to when a felt like nothing. In April I started working and hanging out with my friends more often. By May it all fell apart. I had gotten angry at work from being overwhelmed and two of my friends were working with me that day. They thought that I was satan himself and started to spread rumors about me. As a result I lost all of my friends and almost lost my job. Since then I’ve kept my job but have started to inflict pain upon myself from cuts to burns. I’ve apologized to everyone since but I still hate myself for everything. I’ve felt worse ever since then and have been struggling with my battle against depression once again. I hope that I can get some advice or at least get some comfort so I can try to get back on track",1
"Right now, killing myself sounds like an ideal idea My life is stuck. I've been unemployed since April. I'm 25. Since the outbreak, my family with whom I still live, mainly my father, is putting so much emotional stress on me, yet, without that stress, I don't think I would've gotten to where I am now. You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor. I don't how we do it, but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family, assuming the worst in the other, we lack communication (but isn't that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood?) I don't know where I am right now, but the idea of not existing anymore is tempting me so bad. I'm tired of thinking. I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity. Feels almost like an act of self-love. Edit This is unbelievable! Thank you everyone for your incredible support. I hope everyone struggling finds hope like I have found in your comments. I think hypersensitivity is really a double-edged sword. I can't take negativity so well, but I aslo have the greatest ability to absorp hope and support if I find them, and I have, thanks to you guys. I feel surrounded by friends. It was a good idea to post this. I hope everyone takes the suicidal ideation discussed above with a grain of salt. I was really verging on madness. Who knows what I would have done if I didn't write this. After reading some comments, I'm reminded again that depression lies. Thank you again. I'll try to be kinder to myself.",1
"I don't feel alive, just passing the time I am 28 Years old man, having a 22 years old sister and parents in the family. It is going to be the quite long post, but I think it's important to mention everything. My parents had an arrange marriage 30 years ago. My father comes from a full fledged patriarchal mindset family. When my mother delivered me via C- Section delivery, my father kicked her in the abdomen because she wants to watch TV, and my father wanted to sleep. She had bleeding due to broken stitches but he manipulated my mother and my mother said to doctor that she fell down from stairs. There is no evidence or proof of that incident but it happened. Everyone knows about this in my family but no one talks about it. Throughout their 30 years of marriage, my mother has gone through a lot of mental trauma and abuse. Right now she is 52 years old and is suffering from high blood pressure, anxiety, hypertension and depression. My father is still the same person and regularly tortures my mother. Last week he shouted at her, she got so scared that her blood pressure shot up to 215/120. She said, she felt like that she would die that day. It shattered my heart into pieces. I want to help my mother but my mother still don't want to be vocal about the trauma she is going through and she had gone through. She says that he is after all her husband and still thinks a lot about society and stigma. I highly doubt if I seek any legal help, she would change her statement which will obviously questions her testimony. My father also knows how to take advantage of it and manipulates her for his own purposes. She does everything unwillingly because she thinks that's she is supposed to do and other options are out of her way. I have lost all the respect for my father and chances are I might hit him physically or punch him in the jaw if he'd shout at my mother again. Right now I am staying in a hotel and couldn't sleep for 4 days. My mother will die (breaks my heart) if this keeps going on. My father has no shame or realisation of anything. My sister lives in hostel and haven't come to home since an year, because she is also going through depression and anxiety. I am also going through same issue and taking counselling. I have started meditation also to keep my mind calm but one such incident triggers everything and it pushes my will to live life backward. What should I do? People say that my mother is also indirectly responsible for everything and if she doesn't want to leave him, I shouldn't worry myself and move on with my life. But I can't see her suffering. I know she probably may not know what she is doing, but all I know that she is going through something which she never deserves. Pls suggest.",1
"Managing stress at work. Stress makes me ill. They do not pay me enough to make me ill. Over the years I have stuck to some basic rules. They may already be on /r/stress. Anyway, it is good to share. Negative stress is a term I heard used for things that you have no way of controlling/fixing/moving forward. This type of stress is a killer. If you find yourself dealing with negative stress, tell your boss. You don't work for your boss, your boss works for you. It is their job to make sure you can do yours. The higher up in a company someone works, the more people they work for. Delegate your problems upwards. If you can see a way to de-stress your boss - do it! A stressed boss is hard to delegate to. Positive stress is facing the challenge of doing things that you MIGHT be able to achieve (at least it is in my vocabulary). Positive stress is still stress, although some people get such a kick from it they actually create stressful situations. Avoid these people. I do my best to see problems as challenges. When you have things to do, and you find the sheer volume or complexity daunting, break the job down. I am talking ticking things off. Lists. For quantity, tick off every time you have dealt with X amount of doodahs. For complexity, break the job into smaller tasks, and tick them off as you go. Starting can be the hardest thing - so get ticking as soon as you can. Remember, you can only eat an elephant one bite at a time. EDIT And never break down your day into hours to tick off. Tick off jobs/qty, not time. ",1

"Everything is difficult and I’m losing it This isn’t even just a stress thing. Like everything I do is physically difficult. Other people in my class handed in their work. Mine got turned back twice then I had no paper. My mum said she’d get paper, didn’t get it. She forgot over and over again and I didn’t get the bloody paper till weeks later. Then I messed up my work a bunch of times. Then finally handed it in. I specifically remember handing it in. My teacher says he can’t find it now. I have no drafts nothing. I decided to leave class to go home and quickly do it. It’ll be easy I thought, all my notes are on my computer it’s just a case of drawing circles and numbering them (it’s a design). I got home and my computer is not working. I need the computer to complete this. I could have asked my teacher for his copy of the notes but he is in a meeting. Why is everything in my life like this? I could be asked to take the dog for a walk and somehow my life will find ridiculous things to throw at me. One dog will hurt their paw, another will run off, the leads will snap, somehow there’s no where selling anything that could be used as a lead, the park will be shut at the exact time I was supposed to go, you get the idea. Seriously what the fuck? This is like a sketch on a tv show or something it’s absolutely ridiculous. This always happens and I’m so done. Does anyone else have this? As I said it’s not just stress it’s just something that always happens and it makes me stressed. I don’t know what to do. There is no way I can fix the computer",1
"Just totally apathetic at this stage. Not sad or angry any more, simply don’t feel anything but numbness For a long time, nearly my entire life, I felt a lot of anger and sadness over my situation. I hated my self and everyone else. I never had many friends and because I was a social outcast in my youth I am now at the age of 21 with fuck all friends. Those of which I’m friendly with all have lives of their own and multiple friend groups to juggle so I see them only every few months while I don’t meet anyone in the mean time and go about my day not talking to anyone. I started taking meds and I didn’t notice much difference, so I stopped and made a conscious effort to try to better myself. I started dressing well, started having a hair and skincare routine and exercising and eating right. I’ve put on a decent amount of muscle and I look the best I have ever. For the first time in my life I’ve noticed women looking at me and smiling as I make eye contact with them and smile back. I’m not a bad looking person even though for years I very much felt I was and neglected to care for myself as a result. Despite the validation of seeing these good looking women notice me for the first time ever, it is all in vain. All of my efforts are futile as we walk by each other never to see each other again. I’m not even afraid to talk to women like I used to be, as I have a lot more confidence these days. I feel as though my sudden confidence around women is tied to the fact that I’m just numb and so over it all. All of the effort I put into myself is in vain because nothing ever happens. It was easier when I didn’t take care of myself, didn’t shower, eat or sleep. I put in all of this effort to genuinely look pretty good and yet, it’s all worthless because no one stops to speak to me. They look at me, smile, and keep walking. And so do I.",1

"What should I do about chronic stress Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues. I'm not sure how to deal with it exactly, and it's been 3 months. I remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stress/breakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress. I didn't really know what that meant at the time, but overall I felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice (exercise, things like that) and wisdom didn't really help me or I knew would not work because I had already tried. I even tried antidepressants because I thought it could have been something I needed, but that did not help. I'd say for the past 2 years of my life I've done a great job at handling acute stress. That was the only type of stress I knew. Chronic stress, however, is something that I don't understand. It's new to me, and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective. It feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress. It is admittedly frustrating because I feel too young for it; I'm at an age where I should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff. But instead every day is typically a rollercoaster. My ability to concentrate/focus has been incredibly diminished, and I find the idea of getting back in to school stressful. I am an engineering major, but if math stresses me out I'm just not sure if I can keep it in my life. On the flip side, I want to be doing those things because I liked the challenge. The stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing. I doubly worry because I start to think I have mental health issues, and the fact is that stress CAN open up mental health issues. I find that when the stress gets to a breaking point, which has only happened once in my life, I shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am I supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going. There are things which cause me stress that I don't think are supposed to cause me that much stress, but they simply do because it's chronic I guess. I don't know if I""m supposed to push on and work on my problems in ""the storm"" or withdraw and bide my time. I also seem to suffer from anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. If I isolate myself from anything stressful (school, work, etc.) it is possible to feel some pleasure, albeit a small amount. I've been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure (weightlifting was a big one) and then taking on the more stressful things (school and work), but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects. What really kills me is that my sleep suffers; if I could get 8 hours a night, I would be able to push through without worrying, but for the past 3 nights I've gotten probably 5-6 hours of sleep. I haven't even started school yet, and I don't really work THAT much. So now I'm sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again. I truthfully don't know what to do, or what in particular causes my chronic stress. I want to live life like normally so I can combat depression and things like that, but then the stress keeps me up. I am seeing a counselor, and hopefully a therapist soon, but I am in the early stages of that. Is this something that can be medicated? Can you ""medicate"" stress away? Or does it boil down to lifestyle changes? I've done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years, which is another frustrating thing. I don't drink, smoke, but admittedly I think about sex too much and I'd say that is my vice at the moment. It was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way. That said, I don't pursue sex in an unhealthy way but I might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that I'm missing. I eat pretty healthily, not a fan of soda or junk food, I see food more as calories and less for pleasure. Other than that, I loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting. Now, however, I feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because I know I don't sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress. I want to bulk up a bit, and get back to more intense/heavier lifting, but I'm not sure if that's even healthy for me in my given state. At the same time, I get stressed out after a week or two if I'm NOT doing that. Lol again with the flipping a token thing. I don't really like being around my friends or people as much when I'm like this, not because I am in a ""bad mood"" but because I know I can't simply vibe with them. I'll be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it. This is why I think I really like counseling because it's just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone. My only solace has been learning how to play my guitar, but that's not what I intend to do with the rest of my life, and it doesn't always take the stress away. Sometimes I just get tired of playing it. What are my options? I'm 20 years old, live at home with my dad, so I don't have much responsibility thankfully. I've done quite a bit with my life that I'm happy about, so I feel like I was doing what I wanted, so it's tough thinking about how to change. All the things I've been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you're just not doing anything with yourself. But again now when I start doing those things I experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop, thus depression can come back... I kind of yearn for when things didn't feel this stressful; the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago, and man I thought THAT was a challenge because during that time I was just finding myself. Looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came, not battling it every waking hour. I understand things about mindfulness, meditation, making the right choices, etc., but man that doesn't explain why I can't get enough sleep.",1

"My collection of grief I have never posted here, guess you could say I'm a lurker. Like many others I never thought I deserved to take away from their ""spotlight"" I guess. Like it was selfish for me to think I had it bad when I know others have it worse. It seems like a lot of people go from sorrow to emptiness, I kinda did the opposite and I am sure this is more natural than I think but now it's like I don't know how to handle it. Same old shit, fucked up childhood, fucked family, shitty ex girlfriend who said I abused her 8 months after leaving me for a coworker of mine. Lost family and friends alike. Even had to see a detective about it. No physical abuse but lots and lots of mental stuff. From both my mother and that girlfriend. Don't talk to a big portion of my family now. Only just recently started seeing my dad again. Not because he did anything wrong really but I closed everything off, and everyone. I had to move out, I had no money. So I ended up having to max out my credit card just to survive, car broke down shortly after, now I needed a car. More debt. I became reckless, I used to be great at saving money but when your money just goes to making someone else rich while you struggle to pay for food, I want something for myself sometimes damnit. That was 7 years ago. Now I still have the debt of a broken man, physically in a better place, and realistically mentally too but not by much. I don't get into a car or walk into a building and imagine all the different ways I could kill myself in there, at least not as much. My emptiness has overflowed into a cataclysm of dread and sorrow. I went to therapy finally, quite recently. People say money can't buy happiness but after 8 appointments I got a bill for over 600 dollars. Whoever says that is either a fool or an asshole. After seeing the bill I canceled all further appointments and haven't gon back since. Hadn't gone long enough to make any real progress towards anything. I did however find out that I have a severe form of dysthymia. Which is basically just persistent depressive. And also general anxiety. I'm sure this isn't an unheard of thing but I am basically never not in a state of depression, It's almost like being bipolar, but with a smaller mood range. I am either terribly sad (depressed) or helplessly, hopelessly, exhaustively woven into despair that I crawl into bed after work and cry for hours, and everytime I think its over and try to get out of bed I take a couple steps and realize that I am not done and have to go back to it. Apparently it happens at some point in a lot of people lives but I have never not felt this way, for as long as I can remember. I cant find true joy in anything, my life consists of finding things that might make me happy and working towards obtaining them only to get them and have them become just another thing. I think that is how my collection started, I collect comic books and figurines, books. I think my collection is the only thing I can consider myself proud of though. It's like I can't grow myself so I instead watch it grow, each new thing a small victory, proof that I'm alive and building something. Like some sort of faux legacy to pass on, I am meaningless to this world but maybe I will live on in my stuff, heirlooms to pass down or something. Even when I was empty I believed that I just had to push, that I could make my life something. Prove to people who wronged me that I was worth more. They would live in the shadow of my success and finally feel the worthlessness I have felt. Now though I am not empty, I am losing hope everyday. Is this it? The meaning of life? Not surviving, not prevailing, just existing. Existing until it's not time to exist anymore. Every day you give up just a little bit more, a personal race to break your last record of perseverance. To see how long you can make it, how long it takes for you to give up. Truth is, we all would have given up by now. I am not sure if the reason is the same for everyone. My reason for still being here is because I'm worried the afterlife might be boring. Interesting right? This may be our only time and even if it is terrible and nothing good ever happens, at least I'm not bored. I could be reincarnated as an anime protagonist in a world where my life could mean something, not without turmoil but with wonder and awe, and maybe a harem I don't know (don't judge me). It seemed like a goofy joke at first, reincarnated into a magical world where the problems were different but I could mean something to someone or something, surrounded by friends who are cool but also kind. Throw in some overpowered bullshit powers and I am good to go. It started as a joke but I want that. I want to be somewhere else, I want to be someone else. A different world, I different plane of existence where I could start over without the problems of before. Somewhere where it would be possible to truly find peace. I want that. I dont want to die never knowing what happiness felt like, only to live an eternity of regret and emptiness. Hardships are eternal wherever you go but please let me be able to find joy in things. A quote I always like was ""you can either live a life of meaning, or you can live a life of happiness. You cannot have both."" I already can't be happy, a life of meaning makes the most sense. Now I fear, I will not have either.",1
"I'm 14 and I haven't done any school work for 7 weeks I feel so fucking useless and I just want it to end. We went into another covid lockdown 10 weeks ago and when school started again (online) I did barely any work and now I've just been sitting at my desk feeling empty. I really want to do my work but I just can't. There are 3 more weeks left of the term and all I've been doing is aimlessly surfing the web. I wish I didn't let my teachers and everyone around me down. The other night my dad was talking to me about how bad I was doing at school and that everyone else is better than me. He said that I won't be able to get a job or afford a house. I don't have the best relationship with my dad but after hearing that I just wanted to die. My mum, on the other hand, is very kind and I talked to her for an hour about how I was feeling, but it sort of hurt when she said I wasn't worthless. I think I've been depressed since last year at least, and towards the end things were getting better for me, but after the Christmas holidays, one of my closest friends died and everything just seemed to fall apart. This lockdown seems like it's been my breaking point. I feel completely dead inside. I got diagnosed a few weeks ago and I thought that if people knew (parents and 2 friends) it might get a bit better, but now I feel more alone than ever. I think I should tell my school but 'I was depressed' sounds like a shitty excuse for not working. I want people to know how I'm feeling but I don't want their pity. Sorry, I just needed to rant.",1

"URGENT} 24/7 Head Pressure and Awful Brain Fog Symptoms - 24/7 head pressure in the top back of my head and over my ears to the back. Awful brain fog where I can barely drive or go in stores or do much of anything. I feel like I’m in a dream like state to an extent where everything is in a fog and it’s like I’m not really present (I believe this is called dissociation). I also have blurry vision and just overall feel very off. I can’t remember the last time I felt truly energized and overall just well. This is going to be a long post but I GREATLY appreciate whoever contributes. In October of last year I got extremely stressed. I moved to California and got an apartment 2 weeks before covid hit in March and immediately everything was shut down, buildings were boarded up. I was okay most of the year until I lost my job, and started freaking out about how I’m going to pay rent etc. Also my wisdom teeth started causing problems and I needed to get them removed. Once I found out the price for this (I didn’t have insurance yet) it caused severe stress. It seemed like everything from lack of job, lack of money, lack of social life, lack of interaction was just taking over with physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. I have had nights where I wake up gasping for air as if I’m not breathing, I have had many days where I can’t even walk or do activity because I feel so faint. I have spoke to 2 psychiatrists about this and explained how my symptoms have been 24/7 for now 7 months and they both said they haven’t heard of stress and anxiety being a constant for that long without a break. I have tried lexapro for a month and a half at 10 mg (which I know is a low dose) and it had no effect. I have went to every specialist from ent, neurologist, emergency room twice, eye doctor, neuro ophthalmologist, allergist and gotten every scan imaginable from mri to mra to mrv to ct to angiogram and everything is always normal. These symptoms have pretty much debilitated me from living my life in any way which has then let to depression from having no life. It’s got to the point where just going to a new doctor appointment would make me feel extremely anxious and faint because I feel like it’s just an ongoing series where I go to the doctor and they don’t help and I repeat for months. Everything is just centered around the stress and anxiety of what could be causing this and doctors having no idea. Every single day I search my symptoms and constantly am online looking into this, it’s pretty much all I do. What’s throwing me off is the 2 psychiatrist saying these symptoms can’t be constant because I have seen other posts online saying otherwise. The last psychiatrist said I can try Zoloft. I would appreciate if anyone can comment having dealt with similar symptoms and letting me know if Zoloft or any ssri helped. I know getting off the computer and outside more can be very helpful . Thanks for any feedback",1
"Exams are killing me. The stress and the pressure is real. I can't even enjoy the pleasure I get from my daily activities. I used eating as a way to escape, but it just doesn't work anymore.

"Stress related to low self esteem and surprisingly powerful coping strategy Hi all, I generally suffer from low self esteem. I have periods, where I feel completely worthless. It's not helped by the fact that I have to write weekly status reports at work. When writing a status report, I have to make an account of the progress, I've made during the week. It takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes to write the report, and there's not much to put on to the list. Or so I thought. Last week I decided that I wanted to spare myself from the stress from writing the report and just write down my progress as it was made. The list of completed work tasks were three times as long as ususal. Turns out I'm quite forgetful. This was a major self worth boost, and it made today an all around great and satisfying day. )",1

However, now that job is giving me more anxiety and depression than I think it's worth. it is kind of my dream job until I finish college, but it's full time, while I'm also in school full time as well and they don't have any part-time options for me. I've only been there for about a week, but every single shift I find myself completely dissociated and unable to focus on anything.

"Apparently depression is just ""attention-seeking stupidity"" to people. When I get like this, I tend to google what I'm thinking. I googled one of the biggest things about myself, ""why does making myself feel bad make me feel better"". Super simple, just a lack of better terms. Typical answers were things like ""you were abused as a kid and it became all you know"". Nooe, not it. ""You need a therapist"". I don't want to pay someone just to tell me I have a problem. I know I do. ""Self harm and suicide number"". Typical ""I want to help by not helping so I'll just leave the suicide hotline number instead"". Then one of the answers is a long paragraph about how depression is just attention seeking. You got everything your way when you cried as a kid, so you're crying now in hopes that someone pities you. They'd called it stupidity, and realizing you're just a serial attention seeker will make that stupidity go away. It felt like a dagger was plunged into my chest when I read that. Surely no one agrees with that? Nope. One of the top answers. Fuck. When I cried as a kid because I didn't get what I wanted, I still didn't get what I wanted. I got spanked and sent to my room. I don't want people to give me nice words. On the contrary, I'd rather people be dicks to me. Self-loathing and such is a comfort feeling. And I know that makes me selfish. I harmed after that. I don't cut myself or anything, I'm too much of a stupid fucking pussy. I asphyxiate myself, typically with a chord. This time it was a long piece of plastic packaging that I wrapped around my neck. I've written about this here in the past. I've only recently come to the realization that I use it as a physical and psychological way to make myself feel awful and cause harm, rather than attempt to off myself. I just don't know of this counts as anything more since it doesn't leave a scar... it's probably just some silly dumb thing and nobody takes it seriously because I'm just being a fucking baby. Yeah. That. Well, whatever. Here I am, making a post. Because I'm a serial attention seeker that should just keep all of this inside so I don't spread my stupidity. Silly me.",1
"Hurry Sickness"" – How have I not known about this term!? This type of sickness has plagued me for the past 3+ years I've had increasing amounts of stress as expectations placed upon me, life responsibilities, work responsibilities have increased more and more.

Doing ""more and more and more"" and being able to multitask 15 things at once... it's NOT a trophy. It's a sign of a sickness.

"Is today's world too stressful?? It’s too stressful for some people, and just fine for others. I find it too stressful some days, and other days I feel like I’m coping. Whether or not you feel stressed comes down to your **perspective**. If you think that something’s stressful – guess what – you’re going to f*eel stressed.* **Why Do We Get Stressed?** **Some people feel stressed because of time.** Sometimes it’s hard to believe you can fit everything into one day – you go to a job for 8 to 10 hours, and then you come home and have to do chores and make dinner for you and maybe even an entire family. After dinner you probably have more chores and a checklist of to-do’s that have been eating away at your mind for weeks. You go to bed and then wake up to do it all over again. **Some people feel stressed because of their environments.** Humans have built cities. Concrete, concrete, concrete. Busy, busy, busy. We naturally feel more relaxed when we see green and natural landscapes. But now there’s people everywhere and not a flower in sight. It seems like we never have a minute of calm anymore. Not to mention all the places you have to go in one day. Maybe work is a stressful place. Maybe your house is more chaotic than you want it to be. Even your commute to work can feel stressful sometimes. **Some people feel stressed from meaninglessness.** It’s hard to do the same thing over and over again and feel like you have no end goal. You constantly have chores to do, a job to perform, and likely a family or people to take care of everyday. But, where the heck does it get you at the end of the day? What are you working towards? All of these points make the world sound like a pretty crappy place. But let’s think about the things we **don’t** have to stress about – you probably don’t have to worry about hunting for food, finding shelter in winter, or worry about a bear attacking you and your family. It’s funny how society meets all of our needs, yet w**e still find so many things to be stressed about.** **How Can We Become Un-Stressed?** Unfortunately, it’s hard to eliminate stress completely in one day. We’re **habitual creatures**. You probably get stressed about similar things throughout the week. You have developed stress habits over the course of your life. In order to break these habits, you have to perform **self-checks** and develop **self-awareness** so you can stop yourself before you go down a “stress path”. You have to become **conscious of you stress** before you can stop it. **Figure out what’s making you stressed**. Honestly, a lot of people don’t know what makes them stressed. I have times in the day when I feel anxious, but I have no idea why. So, I started writing things down when I got stressed. I recorded how I felt, what was happening in my environment, and what time of day it was. I also tried journaling a bit at night and performing **self-checks** throughout the busy day. I learned that you have to start talking to yourself. You have to ask yourself *how you’re doing.* From this experience, I found patterns in my stress behaviour. I use [Stress Free]( to keep track of my daily trends. **Simply put, only you cause your own stress**. No matter what you blame your stress on (your environment, your boss, your spouse, your kids), at the end of the day, **your stress is your fault.** Okay, external factors like poverty or an unhealthy marriage obviously don’t facilitate being stressed, but it comes down to realizing that you’re the problem. Until you stop blaming external factors for your stress, you can’t fix it. For example, if you blame your job for your stress, your brain is convinced that the stress will only go away if the job goes away! You’re practicing **self-helplessness**. Before you can make changes, come to the realization that you’re the one making yourself stressed. I know it’s mean, but that’s life. **Feel grateful for what you have.** Sometimes I forget to be grateful for what I have. My family is in good health, I have a wonderful boyfriend, and I have a secure job right out of university. No matter how great of a situation we’re born into or we’ve made for ourselves, we still find ways to be stressed! We make things up in our head – when I get that promotion, I’ll be happy. When I finally get married, I’ll be happy. You can’t just keep looking into the future for your happiness. **You have to practice happiness in the now**. **Try meditation and breathing exercises.** Okay, you’re probably rolling your eyes. Meditation and mindfulness seem to becoming buzz words now. But in all honesty, meditation is how I developed my self-awarness. I’m constantly training myself to check in with my emotions and stop myself from going down my “stress paths”. It’s hard to meditate at first. It’s hard to sit in silence and ask yourself tough questions. I mean, when do we ever experience complete silence anymore? We’re either on our phone, listening to music, watching Netflix, or keeping ourselves busy. So practice **literally doing nothing**. **Eat healthier. Get more sleep**. You’ve probably read a lot of blog articles about getting your beauty sleep or eating “super foods”. I approach these rules in my own way – I try to eat a bit of everything, but mostly things that come from the ground. I wanted to see what happened if I removed sugar from my diet. Within a couple of weeks (yes, the first few days were hard!), I noticed I felt less anxious and I no longer craved buying sweets on my weekly trip to the grocery store. When I added a small salad to my daily diet, I noticed my hair was growing faster and my nails got stronger. So, you don’t have to eat only kale. Just try branching out and eating some veggies you wouldn’t normally eat. Take it one day at a time, and turn it into a habit. Habits are your worst enemy, but they can also be your best friend (when you take the time to develop good habits). It can take several weeks to replace a bad habit with a good one. I like to focus on **improving myself by 0.01% a day**. And not everyday will be better. I’m a person, and sometimes I just have sad days. But start to check in with yourself, figure out what’s making you stressed, and try to love yourself more. The world is only stressful if you see it that way. Do the hard thing and convince yourself otherwise. ",1

"My world is so much fuller with people who love me than I could've ever expected (bonus pic of adorable dog included) A few days ago in a moment of crisis, I nearly made a permanent choice to a temporary situation. It's so strange to think about now, I didn't even recognize who I was was at the time-- it was practically an out of body experience. The one person who I had thought would always have my back if I ever found myself in this situation couldn't help me and wasn't able to for a few reasons. Anyhow, for the last year or so, I've largely viewed myself as being alone on this spinning rock of seven billion people and I sure as hell was convinced of it at the moment. One call with someone I hadn't talked to in nearly half a year stopped me from committing the irreversible. From that moment on and since then, there has been someone there for me, to support me. First, there was my younger sister, who I've had a strained relationship the past few years. She told me she loved me and has been talking/ messaging me since. An aunt who I never in a million years would've expected to care came and got me. Her with two of her friends on vacation talked with me, listened for hours to everything I had to say. They fed me, gave me clarity on a lot and supported me in ways I never would've expected from anyone. The aunt gave me her number and told me to message her if I ever needed anything. My dad has been calling me almost every day and he said he'd be there in any way I needed him to. My mom hugged me and we cried. She too has been giving me a lot of advice and talking to me about a lot of things. Beyond them, so many other people as well have reached out to me-- business associates, old friends, family distant and close, and even acquaintances. My email and phones have had so many notifications from all of them. It's blown my mind how many people care about my well being. The past few years, I've focused so much of my time and energy into building my profession and businesses, traveling, putting my love for what I do above everything else, even my own well being and time spent with others. It got to the point where everyone around me was just like a blimp in the past paced rhythm of my life. I had met a girl and she was the only constant for most of the last nine months. There are so many things I would've missed out on if it hadn't been for the support I received and it's been weighing heavily on my mind. I wouldn't have been able to pet my cat or take my dog on another walk. My family would've been devastated. I would've never able again to watch another sunset or feel the wind on my skin while driving with the windows down. I would've never been able to get a second master's degree, take another great picture (I'm a pro photog), travel any more or meet any more terrific people. I would've never gotten to buy a house, settle down, meet and marry a wife one day, or even have kids. I am just so glad I am still here, still alive. Rumi said, ""The would is the place where the light enters,"" and now I can see that so clearly. I never knew or imagined I mattered so much to so many people. I have so much relief that I am still here, still alive. You really never know who will actually be there to support you when push comes to shove. Even now, I am just looking out the window as I write this, looking at the ocean and the clouds, and I am realizing how beautiful of a day it is. I am truly am grateful to be apart of it. I'm committed now to bettering myself in my deficits, am getting the help I need, and I am going to make the most of this opportunity to still be here. I will not make the same near mistake again. Also, for the hell of it, [here]( is a bonus video of my beloved dog. I hope all of you are doing well and are okay, Reddit. Have a beautiful day!",0
Depression domino Does anyone else get mad that they struggle with depression? Today has been exhausting for me which makes me stressed & depressed. Then I get mad that I’m depressed. Like “why can’t I just function like a normal person?”,1
Is anyone else strangely sick of being high functioning? I know that the fact that I can brush my teeth and shower each day and show up to work each day is a blessing with my depression. But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?,1

"Am just being unreasonable? I'm a guy in the mid 30's, had only a single relationship and intimacy partner so far and I'm almost literally dying to be close to a girl. But through that relationship, I learned a lot about myself, which did not improved my already broken self image. One thing is, that I can't have a serious relationship with a girl I barely feel attracted to. Might sound like a no-brainer, but I mean by character and looks. Character alone will just end badly because of the second problem there always **will** be a more attractive girl. Again, maybe a no-brainer even if alone for statistical reasons, but it's still a problem with/for me. No matter how attractive ""my"" girl would be, eventually there'd be a more attractive one, 'stealing' at least part of my attention, intentionally or not. But what I mean with this so far is just how I would end up feeling, as far as attractiveness by looks go. Just because there is another girl which looks more attractive than ""mine"", doesn't mean I'd dare to drop or intentionally neglect her. But I am also not that dense to think that everything's going to be fine, if I end up fantasizing about another girl. That just hurts, no matter if it's by being found out or just open about it, having your SO correctly guess it, or incorrectly assume it. It's painful at least if not outright insulting, regardless of being in control about those feelings or not. So when I end up day dreaming again, about having a cute girlfriend, the spiral to hell goes down fast Starting with my self-hate for being a hypocrite by wishing for a ""cute"" girlfriend while I'm at best just average looking. Then it steps up to how I deserve not even an equally ""average"" looking one, for the reasons above. And eventually I end up at the burnt in perception, that I'm just a waste of space and resources, which should never have come to existence. So I'm wondering is my self image just broken, or am I really just a fuck boy with depressions?",1
I feel like my depression and anxiety has prevented me from reaching my true potential I always felt that I could have been something way better than I am now.

What are some way to help get rid or at least cope with stress?",1
No passion I’m not sure if this is a problem only I have it not but I feel like I have no passion for anything. I have tried so many different things and end up giving up within a few weeks the only hobbies I really had was basketball and cuz of lockdown I can’t play so I’ve been stuck in my house cooped up and feeling depressed but mostly disappointed in myself for the pure fact I’m incapable of finding something sturdy I know I’m only 16 and should be enjoying myself but that’s hard to do when society and my family make it so hard on me to just be calm and not have a general direction for the future so far I’m in school for mechanics since I thought it would be easier since I’m better with my hands and my heads pretty fogged up most the time but instead I’m stuck in the house with no real mental stimulation trying to do maths and other things in the morning but I guess everyone’s fighting their own demons. If u have any advice on how u try and stay calm during stressful patches please tell me since it would be greatly appreciated.,1
"Headaches and bodily pain from constant stress I’m a full time student and have been working part time jobs since I began last fall. I’m 26, no family or safety nets. I have another freelance job but it’s inconsistent and money is incredibly tight. Boss at my day job has been using me as a scapegoat and asking me to do a number of tasks outside my job description. I’m a cook, I wash dishes, I run food, and sometimes have to help the cashiers. Food quality is obviously suffering for this and I am scolded in front of my coworkers throughout the day. She will stand next to me and tell me how to stir a pot, told me I need to ask permission before putting anything in the oven— and I am a trained cook. Then she asks when I’m going to smile for her. I am looking for other jobs, but am not financially secure enough to quit before I do. I try to see my boyfriend on the weekends, but work usually interrupts our time together. This week I was scolded so badly that I have felt ill since I got home— and this was days ago. Headache, anxiety, dread, and exhaustion. I was told I am on the road to being fired, and I have only worked here a month. I’ve been a cook before and have never been in a place with this kind of culture. I’m just wondering how I can survive the stress while I look for another job. My life should be quite good right now, and this job should be very simple! Money and my boss are what drives my stress.",1

I have about fifteen different pieces of paper (well, .doc files) that about five people are expecting from me ASAP. I've been trying so hard to sort it out, but yesterday I came to realize that I actually *can't* unless I get my heart rate just a little bit lower. But anything I try to do to relax myself - talking with friends, my girlfriend, video games, hobbies - is torn up instantly by my brain, telling me I need to do the things I ""need"" to do. What am I supposed to do, when I have to relax but relaxing just stresses me out more.",1
"THE ROOTS OF FEAR! Fear is the expectation of displeasure in the widest sense! In the narrowest sense , fear is aversion of death. Every fear is fear of death, Fear is the expectation of unknown , we fear only what is new. What has become familiar to us loses the capacity to produce fear. death too is to us the absolutely new and unknown for one should be able to die but once to be sure there are neurotics who die every day or at least play at dying. Man endures everything, but not the unknown whose charactestic symbol is the dark faith fulfils a great mission by setting up a positive affirmation in place of the great question mark. When a man fixed on any fearful idea life becomes hell, and it feels no one understands what this man is dealing with .. all of us have been in fearful situations but some people are daily living this hell, Among the common fears people told me about - fear of rejection is big, when someone feels that no matter how he or she tries will be rejected, so the person becomes his own rejecter and he always pull himself back . - fear of abandonment a person with this fear he or she always pushing away people for his life because he has doubts about why people interested in him and he has shame persona based. - fear of success there's some people no matter what effort they take, they always fail because they fear Being successful that means unconsciously to them success is bad and dangerous. - fear of intimate relationships a lot of people are dealing with sexual shame without being aware of that, intimacy means pain and danger. - fear of oneself that's when a person is escaping himself all the time relying on drugs or some form of escapism such like porn. Working all the time. Gambling... Those are common fears that I find with my clients .. hope this post benefit you guys .. for any questions chat me .. peace sparkles ",1

Work is giving me stress I get criticised every week and I've only been here about a month. They're saying my customer service is bad because I don't know where the things in the shop are when someone asks me.

"Have Melt Downs Every Day I have been in a relationship for about three years now. I started dating him in grade 10, the first year was amazing. But then came lies, ignoring me, he once left me and went to Wonderland with his friends. He ignores me on all holidays saying that he is busy with his family. Busy enough that he won't even reply back to me. I get mad and he says he loves me so much. he never gets me any birthday gifts, Valentine's day gifts, anniversary gifts. He lives around 2 hours away from me. So whenever he comes, I feel it's just for sexual favours and then he leaves and ignores me, doesn't call me. Even if he does call me it's about horny stuff most of the time. I have tried to break up with him, but he doesn't let me and I get weak also. I get weak to think that I can't live without him, and things will get better. I lost my friends because of him, I have no one to share anything with. My parents are the worst. My mom is the most judgemental person I have met. I sometimes wish she was not my mom. My sister does not like me, I am not sure why. She kind of gets my brother against me. She yells and misbehaves with me. and we are 13 years apart. My mom is always taking her side and always favours her. They all think I do nothing in life. Even tho, I work 20 hours a week and I study full-time at UTM. So recently, I found the courage to break-up with my boyfriend, I blocked him everywhere. He keeps texting me from new accounts and I keep getting weak, I keep thinking about him and imagining our future. I guess a reason for being weak is that I will be in an arranged marriage by 22 years old in Pakistan. My boyfriend is serious about marrying me, but my family won't agree on a love marriage plus my boyfriend makes me cry, feel ignored, and makes me feel alone. School is another kind of stress I'm facing, with too many assignments. I have breakdowns every now and then. No food or groceries at home and I need to save money to pay for school. I'm starving, crying, having exams and assignments due. I am so pathetic that I don't have the courage to end myself. I am heartbroken, hurt, and a loser. Should I just go back to my boyfriend? If I don't I will end up in Pakistan with my toxic family and I will have a kid by 23 years of age and will be a maid for free.",1
"about beauty well, I have this little monologue about the word I love and hate. Sometimes I think about what beautiful is, who taught you the reader,who taught me what beautiful is.All I see is that I am far from beautiful and those Instagram people I see are breathtakingly beautiful sometimes it makes me cry looking at them so I don't. Social media has,at least on me burned those two or three stereotypes of perfect beauty and of course I am like most p eople not them.I wonder if I was those having popularly celebrated features, If I know myself correctly wouldn't have been writing this. But really what is beauty, what is physically attractive, I have many famous and normal people I find beautiful, but its not me, its just not me because I don't have that eyes, that jaw,that body that face. Every time I look in the mirror, I try to make the reflection look but I can't, It doesn't stop looking anything but ugly. I use things to get that perfect skin ,hair and everything,but nothing works, I can't look at the mirror without despising what I see. I would not mention my insecurities because it makes me feel like people will be out to get me, even they people who love and care about me beyond physical attraction, I never tell them because even when they do not care, I don't want any human to see and take notice. My loved ones try to tell me that external beauty doesn't matter and that I'm still pretty nevertheless but I cannot believe them when I try to. People are obsessed with their beauty and I'm obsessed with my ugliness. Why am I so shallow for myself, why am I kind to everyone but me. At the end of the day, I hate to admit it but I wish I looked like those girls I want to be the universally accepted beautiful. Anyone would tell me I'm one of the kindest and empathetic person they have met in a while but I'm shallow to me, I'm unkind to me. Frankly I hate me. I'm not beautiful,and I believe I cant change that, I hate me and I cant change that, I hurt everyday when I see myself but I guess I can learn to live with that. I'm just okay because I have beautiful souls that care for me. Guess I will keep writing sharing these hateful monologue to myself. Thank you for reading.",1

"I need help / Mental Help Hi everyone. I am senior student in Grade 12 and I have AP Bio and Chemistry 12 in the same semester. Very recently I became overwhelmed with the amount of homework and constant tests/quizzes that I cry every other day, and I’m at the point where my Mental health is not safe, anymore. Somedays, I often just want to give up on these tests and just don’t care what happens in these courses. This issue occurred in Grade 12 only as in Grade 10 I would have the same exact amount of homework and I would never experience mental breakdowns like this. I would just sit there and do homework and then all of a sudden break down and cry out. I don’t know if this is signs of early depression, too much anxiety, can someone please help me out?",1
"I'm really stressed from school, but my dad will kill me if I'm not in honors My dad is very invested in my schoolwork, and grades, if I get anything other than an A in my classes he would punish me (not beat me or anything, like take away devises). But I can get really stressed out from all the pressure, and I tend to just stop working all together, or just not get out of bed. And being with my parents in lockdown has made me double stressed, but I'm not allowed to just lie in bed and forget I exist, so I used to goof around on m computer, and ignore my work. I know I can do it but whenever I try I end up crying because I don't know something. And this usually happens with math. Sooo... i haven't done my math in months, because I think I'm stupid and can't do anything. My dad just found out I haven't done math in a while, and said ""you're making me really depressed"". And now I don't know what to do. because if I get kicked out of honors math my dad will kill me, but if i stay in it I will be miserable. what do I do?",1

"In a stressful, anxious and lonely period. How to cope with it? Many things have happened in just 7 days. I broke up with my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship lasted a year. Even tho it was all toxic I miss him, to distract myself I should hang out with people, but honestly.. I'm not good with people. I don't have lots of friends, and they are not even good.. My third year in high school is ending and it's really stressful with last tests. I have 3 more weeks to go but it feels like eternity. I decided that I will study more to get a 3.0 GPA so that I can access to college. But to attend college in America.. I will go there and live by my own. So all these thoughts are making me exhausted. I feel like I want to isolate myself more than I already am. Like, as soon as I finish my school day, I'll head home and try to relax. I don't want to see anyone and talk to anyone. My mother said that it's been too much time since I actually made a real smile, not a fake one. It's just that I have priorities (like college) and I can't seem to mantain friendships because I'm so emotionally beaten down and stressed. I see everyone like an enemy now I started to dislike everyone for their shitty behavior. Everyone is just so annoying and kinda mean these days.

"I need help with my severely depressed partner Hello everyone, bit of a situation here and I don't know who to ask for advice. My partner and I have been together for almost 2 years and he has suffered from depression since he was 15 (now 33). Due to me getting s new job, around April we decided to move out of his parents house (they let me stay there to save money, and he has never moved out). Now that the time has come, he can't move out. He feels too anxious and he starts panicking. He says he feels stuck and he'll never be able to turn his life around. He also says it's too hard for him to get out of his comfort zone (his parents' house). What can I do to help? We've spend at least £100 on train tickets which we haven't taken, our boxes are already at the new place. Yesterday we almost went but then he refused because he had an episode and he was feeling really down and kept telling himself that his life is finished and there's no way to be happy. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to move with him, he wants to move too but his depression and anxiety are preventing him to be happy. I wake up every morning and I cry next to him because I don't see a way out and I'm scared. Thank you.",1
"My girlfriend died Hey Everybody. I’m writing this to vent. About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch. We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life. I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though. Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me. I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here. It feels good to write this though. For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her. Thanks for reading.

Two days ago i found a job and i called my mother who started yelling at me for not having contacted her earlier and afterwards i called my boyfriend who told me it wasn't such a big deal and didn't seem to care much only in the evening i called my best friend who told me it was great news In general my other friends don't really care they are only for going out and to study. They are near me but i dont feel like contacting them. My boyfriend is really good but he can't understand my problems and he is a little irritable. As for my family there is only my mother, who lives in her own world and older brother who has his job and life so we talk every once in a while!

My parents have really really high standards for me.

Anyway, the conversation between my parents and I escalated to whether they were proud of me or not. My mother said she was proud, but she is really nice so I didn't think much of it. Then, my strict father, said this ""What makes you think I'm not proud of you?"" Now, I'm a 13 year old. I'm in eighth grade. At least for me, at this age, I want to be the tough, thick-skinned one. Things aren't supposed to get to me. But right there, at the dinner table, over rice and chinese dishes, I started crying. I finally did it! I finally got my father to be proud...

I wish I could lose my life in my sleep and give it to someone who could use it for good. I'm incapable of even bathing myself and eating. I have the saddest life ever. I don't deserve this. I just wish my family were OK with it so that I could commit suicide.",1
"How to get rid of the emptiness? Past months suicidal thoughts and rampant selfhate always plagued me, did some selfharm and stuff. But over the past weeks I somewhat got rid of them...or they just left me can't say. But now I feel just empty...I feel like all the selfhate and others burned me out...I don't feel happiness or anything really, the world feels unreal to me. Sometimes this emptiness consumes me for hours until I fall asleep eventually. I just have no idea how to break out of this, I don't have fun hobbies, everything feels dull and unexciting.",1
"Felt like venting. Might delete later. Every day is just getting worse. I'm losing my mind silently. No motivation, no self confidence, no self love, no more reasons to stay alive. I'm just stuck in this world. No courage to end it all, too tired to move on. I can only wish I was dead. My social awkwardness and my naturally socially distant personality has fucked me up real bad (Not to mention the mad anxiety that comes as a perk). I could never be a good friend, a good son, a good brother. I can never ever open up to anyone anymore, and that thought just makes it all even worse. As if all this wasn't enough, now I have to live in a house that was once a home.",1
"Sometimes I wonder why I try... This'll probably be a little different from the usual posts here. But the result is the same. I just find myself wondering why I fight at this point. I feel like I'm surrounded by idiots. That sounds conceited, but I don't care anymore. I try to reach a common viewpoint, understand theirs, and them understand mine. But, in the end, it's pointless. You know, I argued with a guy today who told me capitalism is bad because, under capitalism, the people are exploited by businesses. He has, prior to this, told me how he does not pay bus fair because no one enforces it. I brought this up to him, and he of course simply ignored it. Meanwhile, I feel like, socially, I'm just spinning my wheels. I feel like I'm never truly improving. I'm 26 and still have yet to really experience any kind of romantic relationship. I'm more inclined to talk about myself, not out of narcissism necessarily, but rather because it's all I can think to do to relate to people. I'm a bit full of myself, but I've earned that. I'm smart, and I save lives. I do it as a volunteer, and I'll be further saving lives in Nursing. To that end, I'm surrounded by idiots at college. Not the normal idiots. the professors. I had a stat professor once give me the wrong explanation of probability fractions. He said that, to find the probability of at least 1, I'd use the formula 1-P1 (1 minus the probability of 1). This is wrong. I brought this to another professor of stat. She gave me the write answer. This man proceeded to explain to me, in depth on the opposite side of this index card with the right answer, why that was wrong. During the test, the answers were right, but another question we all got right, but were graded as getting it wrong. We spent 30 minutes arguing for the right grade. All this frustration, and I fail out of nursing program on the second to last semester. The dean was teaching, though someone else was lecturing. The dean, however, wrote the tests. I'm 26 now. I know given the time of day, I'd pass with flying colors and make an excellent nurse. However, I'm now having to finish this and restart. Of course, who cares. Anyone I tell that to will just tell me I'm not for the job. Never mind I discuss what I learned with doctors and Nurses. I know my shit, not all of it, but rather than teach, they just blindly follow policy. It is what it is. You can't fight the system, so adapt. That's always been how I operate, but, at this point, I wonder why I even bother. I LOVED my time in the hospital for clinicals, and I want nothing more than to continue to work there. But why fight to go back. What's the point of living a life where I am always fighting uphill for the bits of joy I can get. I can't connect with anyone, and when I do, they ultimately stop talking to me. Even worse, when someone is around, I constantly think that I'm just blind to how annoyed they are by me. I'm stuck between thinking I'm smart, and thinking I'm an immature dolt. I've spent years trying to work through all this, but, I'm left wondering what it's all for. What's the payoff? Will there even be a payoff? I keep thinking if I work hard enough, the enjoyable parts will begin to outnumber the miserable ones. Don't get me wrong, there are days that are fun, and those are great, but it seems like I have to fight to get to them, only to get knocked back. Is this all life is? Does it ever get to a point where I can enjoy more than I loathe? I probably feel this way because I'm depressed. It's not 24/7, but I understand there's some kind of depression colloquially called ""walking depression."" Who knows. I won't get diagnosed. I don't need a doctor to sit here and tell me what I already know. He/She will outline treatment. Of course SSRIs, tricyclics, MOAIs. Hell, I'd probably feel better. But I can do this on my own. I've made it this far. I just wish I could get assurance that I'm not wasting my time. If this is as good as it gets, I might as well kill myself now. I could at least die remotely happy knowing every weekend has been a new adventure, I died in my prime, and I didn't spend decades fighting for an unattainable goal.",1
"Exam Stress Hello guys, I would like to say that normally I am a very happy and less-stressed person. I try to stay positive in most of the situations. But recently I gave my exams and failed badly. And now, I have my competitive exams again, coming up in next few months, and the fear of failure has been making me go through extreme stress since the end of December. My body has never experienced this, lol! Due to this 1. I cant sleep properly and 2. My hair is falling out like crazy (like 150-200) a day. 3. I am breaking out I also stopped exercising for the sake of studying. Could you guys please suggest me some methods to instantly reduce stress? I know exercise is one of them but I need more alternatives. Thanking you in advance!",1

"I'm sick of this I'm so sick of this. Everything feels so numb and empty, then randomly a huge wave of sadness hits. I try to distract myself with work but I can't escape. My hobbies are not fun anymore. I want to learn new things but I have no motivation and every little thing frustrates me so much. I am very curious and love to learn new things but its so hard with the brain fog. Feels like I'm actually getting more stupid everyday. I hate it. Nothing is fun anymore. Everything is so exhausting. Sometimes I just want someone to hug me, cuddle me and tell me that they love me, but most of the time I want to go away from everyone and everything. The news is depressing. I am so tired of everything but still can't fall asleep at night. I have lost all joy in my life. I want to be me again. I want to know how it feels to be happy again without taking drugs. I am im my 20s, shouldn't that be a great time in life? A time where you look back when you're older and think of all the experiences you made, wishing you were 20 again? All I have in my 20s is depression, anxiety and loneliness. I can't believe my life has become so sad.",1
"I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed. People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close. Edit wow I didn’t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes!

A lot of the time i don't want to get out but i do.. other times i DO but don't have the energy to.. a lot of the time in order to do get out of bed i need first for like 10-30min imagine the whole process to get used to it. Like half a year ago i didn't get out of bed,hated myself,lived of of fruit and ice-cream and i cut myself. Now i wake up 7-11am get out of bed at 10-1pm. I often come back to it throughout the day but that's okay. I try to do my chores but it's always overwhelming and a lot.. though some of the time i actually manage to finished. Social services/CPS even said it's a bit too much chores so i guess it's ok that I'm not managing everything.. I eat 2-4 ""meals"" a day and fruit. Manage to go outside (mostly to my rabbits but that's beside the point) and sometimes take pictures of cool bugs and my cat or rabbits. Showering is still a problem but I'm trying. I'm doing A LOT!! I also care for all my pets. I'm working on spending a bit more time with the animals that are social (re-taming them a bit) but the rabbits are in a group of 4 so they give eachother company while a stick insect doesn't need any attention other than cleaning and water every 3 days. Everything is overwhelming. I'm stressed about everything. I'm always stressed, anxious and on edge.. I'm constantly tired yet keep pushing myself (in both a bad and good way), i have slightly higher self esteem, i learned to not hate myself but instead certain parts of my body (gender dysphoria) and the one who made me feel bad in the first place My father. Nothing is ever enough. It doesn't matter if i tried or did most of the work as long as i didn't do EVERYTHING I'm supposed to it's not good enough. So what if i cleaned the kitchen and put up the clean laundry if i didn't throw out empty toilet paper rolls. He doesn't understand that I'm not getting up not because i need to sleep earlier but cos I'm depressed. I tried explaining but he doesn't really believe in mental health. Its weekend, we wake up at 6-7 am and start cleaning. ..... I'm not able to anymore. He shouts for every little thing and has anything against anyone. I hate him. I'm trying. ^Trigger warning^ I was bullied 2 years ago at school and online, had much worse stomach problems, didn't really do chores, cut myself, hated myself, hit myself, my plants for life was""be dead by 15"" wanted to overdose (but my dumb 12yo ass took first medicine i saw which turned out to be antistress pills so i just had a stomach ache) AND YET I'M THE CLOSEST AND MOST SERIOUS ABOUT ENDING MY LIFE EVERY DAY NOW.

But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that.

So I stopped being positive about things and instead tried to work towards it but in a much more suspicious way. So for now for example I'm trying to find a new place to live (seperating from wife) and all seemingly good places I find are either snapped up too quickly or out of budget, and I'm just so down and negative that I can't keep away from thinking positively. This means that because I'm in a bad place I can't see myself getting out of it, thinking of getting my life together just doesn't seem possible and I get down thinking that I'll end up living a miserable loveless lonely boring life, therefor depleting any drive I have to try, I've essentially just given up regarding working hard for something good and settling for whatever life throws my way sleepy_face ",1
Need to vent a bit Hi all. ,1
"I just kissed for the first time, at age 21 2 days ago I (M21) had my first date ever with a young woman (20F). We had been texting for 3 weeks and had called a few times so we already knew each other pretty well. We met up and decided to stay in the car and get coffee as it was raining. We parked in a quiet spot next to a river and talked while listening to music and drinking our coffee. I then told her I really liked her and she said she did too. We gazed at each others' eyes and I looked down very briefly at her lips, so did she. We went for the kiss and made out for quite a while. I was like 'that was nice', and we dit it again! She laid her head on my shoulder and the feeling that gave me was literally out of this world. We decided to go for a little highway cruise while listening to music and talking and she held my hand the entire time. I dropped her back off home after 2 hours and a half and we kissed twice again. We hugged and she told me she didn't want to let go. A month before this I felt like a total loser for never having even touched a girls hand and look at me now, I feel like a million bucks. I have a feeling she might soon be my first girlfriend, too...",0

"Had a really good day today and just wanted to share So where do I start, this year has been rough from a failed coming out to covid to a life changing breakup. While life has been pretty shitty for my mental health today was a sign of happiness. Living with my parents has been rough since I’ve been having to fake being straight and just hide being gay. But today I got to see my amazing boyfriend, and yes we’re both closeted and we met on grindr. However despite it being hard for both of us we make it work and honestly I’ve never loved someone as much before. I’ve never gotten happy over someone else’s accomplishments before. I’ve never loved someone no matter if they get a new tattoo or piercing. But he changes all of that. But back to today. I was able to talk to my aunt who I haven’t seen in a while, she doesn’t know I’m gay but loves me a lot. We was talking about moving out for me and we talked about how hard it will be for my parents. But we finally both agreed that it kinda has to happen one day and what’s a better time than now. Fast forward to a few hours later after I saw my bf I was talking to my dad about the idea and I’ve never mentioned it till now and was so worried because they hate the idea of me leaving them. If it was up to them I’d live with them forever. But he took it rather well. I told him it’s not like I’d move far away legit just like 10 minutes away from our house. And while he hated it he understood to an extent. It just made me super happy because while it’s just a small step it gives me hope that one day I’ll be able to be truly happy and free. My mom however that’s gonna be a true battle but I’ll wait for another day for that. If someone told me in March when I was not eating for weeks and just crying every night that I’d have an amazing boyfriend and an actual chance at being able to be an adult I’d think you was crazy. There is hope and I hope everyone else has a great day/night. Thanks for reading if you did.",0

"Stockpile of meds cw suicide Hi, I've honestly been suicidal for like 20 years. I am 30 now. I can't imagine a life where suicide isn't an option. I can't imagine getting better. I decided to be slightly more honest with my therapist and im going to be going for partial hospitalization soon. So, due to having many mental illnesses, I have been on a LOT of meds, some of which were on a trial basis... and I have kept them all. I have enough of one particular med to kill myself. I am not currently on this med and it is not useful to me in any way besides killing myself. I cannot imagine myself ever willingly getting rid of my stash. I obviously haven't told my care team I have it. I've had it since 2014 when I stopped that particular med. It will still work even though it's old. Like, I feel like I NEED that out. So, when/if I get better, do you think I would be willing to get rid of it? Honestly the thought of that is scary and makes me not want to get better. I need the out. I know there are other ways to go, but this is the method I have chosen, that i am most comfortable with for various reasons. If im honest with my care team and tell them about it, and that I refuse to get rid of it even though there have been a few times this month I was seriously considering using it, will I be stuck in a hospital until I commit to throwing my stash away? I KNOW that by having it here I am in danger. I don't care, I need it. I mean I've had it for years without using it so I'm pretty safe I think, usually.

"Advice needed, I just broke down because of stress Pretty much the title. I'm a 22 year old dental hygiene student. Besides my study demanding a lot of time, energy and effort, it definitely doesn't help that I have to force myself to work extra because I'm broke. Another thing that doesn't help is that I haven't seen my long distance partner in almost a year. Since this school year started I've been under non stop stress. In November I felt like I was extremely close to a big breakdown and potentionally a burnout, but I somehow managed to dodge that bullet. Since that I've been trying to fake it until I make it, except it's getting really hard now to pretend that everything is OK. Last semester I barely passed my exams (which disappointed me, I always aim to get good results and I get disappointed and feel guilty when I don't). The last exams of this year are coming up, next to that I have 5 other deadlines and an internship to finish, all in 2 weeks time. Every morning I wake up in sheer panic trying to remember what day it is to get myself mentally prepared for deadline stress, study stress, work stress or performance stress. Sometimes a combination of two, three or all of them. I don't even know if this was the right place to post it, but I had to let it out somewhere. I don't feel comfortable opening up to my parents and my partner doesn't seem to understand me very much when it comes to these type of things.

Now since this fundraiser has been publicly named via email with local news, I get black lash because the article printed was not approved by the committee. and it is a 'sensitive' topic. I guess I am done helping them with this fundraiser. Every public article has to be approved and that takes a couple of weeks to get approval since they do not meet that often. Our event is next month. Try to get funds for a fundraiser but do it quietly, and not make any noise. Oh and it has to be approved by committee. Go Get Em.",0
"School fucked me up Just wanna find a vent I’ve always been the all A’s student at my school and everyone has so much expectations on me. I’ve always have this cheerful bubbly personality on the outside, but I’ve never been actually happy about my current life. I feel so stressed and i kept crying constantly because of academic pressure and my teacher’s expectation. It has gotten to the point where I can’t take care of myself and I even took a day off from school because of that recently. (Happened about 2 weeks ago) I’ve picked myself up but ever since that incident I will cry for no reason and have a mental breakdown over really small things. My motivation has been decreasing rapidly and I’ll constantly isolate myself from interacting with anyone. I just got scolded by my mom and I’m now all by myself, crying alone. My concentration has also become worse the older I got, I used to be able to read a book in one sitting, now I can’t even finish a single page of homework. I’ve been struggling so hard to get my work done but I can’t. I had to stay up really late every night (2am - 4am) only to get my work done. But I have to wake up 7am in the morning everyday for school. It’s honestly torturing and I literally wanna die. Aside from mental health issues, it causes my body to react negatively, I stopped having my period whenever school starts and I will gain fat really rapidly. The more fat I gain, the more insecure I get, I don’t even wanna go out because of my fat body. I tried to tell my friends, they are really supportive, but whenever my depressive feelings strike, I just don’t have the motivation to speak to them, I wanna keep them out from my negative feelings, the same goes to my family. School and academic stress has fucked me up entirely but I cannot stop it. I cannot quit school or I will lose my seemingly “bright” future, but I don’t know how long I can do this anymore. TLDR school gave me too much pressure for being the top student, fucked up my mental and physical health. I cannot do this anymore.",1

"I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do. I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year. I have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute. I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me. People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point. I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing. Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain. Merry fucking Christmas to me.",1

"Just burst into tears at work. So, I've been with my company for 16 years. Always loved it. Good at my job, if I do say so myself. In January I got a big promotion, to supervisor. Last month I got another to a salaried management position. I'm quarterbacking a very major project involving integrating our facility with a corporate call center. It's going to change daily life for us forever. We're launching this week. Guys, we're around ten people short. There's no way we can even do basic daily functionality, much less all the crazy shit this project entails. I'm working 12+ hours a day at least 5 days a week, and usually going in for 5-10 hours over the weekend. I'm working so much just to fill holes because there's literally nobody else to do it. All my people are working overtime and burned the fuck out. I came in at 4am to do some stuff nobody else was able to do last night, and then I was working on payroll and looking at this absolute abortion of a schedule any I couldn't help but burst into tears in front of my crew. Not like ugly crying, but stoic like silent tears. I'm exasperated. I'm not an emotional guy but I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I'm being an asshole to my family on the rare occasion I ever see them. It's causing a lot of problems, but my field is extremely limited. Not many opportunities around here for me. I'm just a schlub with no degree and an easy certification and I feel like I'm drowning. If I had people it would be easy, but getting people in here takes months with this sloth-like corporate structure. I seriously am just sitting in my car on the side of a country road right now, just not knowing what to do. I'm feeling completely spent and empty. Thinking about the place makes me want to cry again. Ah well, feels a little better to just talk about it.",1
how do I make friends I’m 17 years old attending an adult school(mostly online) to get my diploma after i failed grade 12 last year and I’m struggling to find a job. My previous friends moved away to university I’m not as suicidal as I used to be I just feel like an old bum with no diploma who can’t find friends even thought I’m only 17.

"No one showed. I should have expected that. I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different. Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook. She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless. Edit Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again. Edit 2 I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",1
"How was I a straight A student I just realized something while doing homework for my duel enrollment course, I saw my banner that my school gave me. It says ""Scholar 4.0+"" gpa. I don't understand how I did that. I just remember feeling lifeless through those years because I had no social life. I definitely wasn't smart. Now I can't seem to keep up with me classes, it's so exhausting. And I also don't try. I don't think I'll get back those Scholar habits. I make such bad impressions on my teachers now. I'm not the same person I was before I had depression",1

"I don't think this is depression, but it sure feels like it? Hello! I am in a weird situation right now, and I don't really know who to talk to about it or anything. So I am hoping I might get some help or support here. I've had bad depression years ago after my sister passed. I could not be happy no matter what. I talked to my doctor, who convinced me to go to a psych ward in a hospital. I am sure it was precautionary and meant to be helpful, but it was more annoying than anything. I had no inclination to self harm, was stuck in a boring and sometimes scary place for 12 hours, to finally be discharged by a psychologist at 2am. Meanwhile, my husband is crying at home. I felt a little played. I was on antidepressants for about a year and then got through the depression. Thing have been great since then. But about a month ago, I noticed a change. It happened when I got back from vacation. My anniversary is on the 25th, and my birthday is the 26th, so my husband and I took a vacation that week. It was fun (busy!). But when I got back to the normal routine - I just don't have the desire to do anything anymore. I used to play games on my computer for hours - now, I just kind of sit here. I would find a ton of things to do while working - now I don't really want to do anything. When my husband would be at work, I would try learning to mod a game. Or when he was home, we would watch tv and stuff. I still do that - but have no interest to do anything else. I am still happy, at least with my husband. I still look at memes and laugh. I still love hanging with my dogs. But I am just not interested in anything else. This was different from my last depressive episode, but feels pretty similar. Except before, I didn't find almost any interest in anything, while now I kind of don't want to do anything, especially alone. I hope this is making sense. I don't know if this is depression again, but not a typical depression. Last time I had depression, my doctor suspected a big vitamin D deficiency I had at the time, so maybe it is something similar. I have ADHD and was off my usual routine for over a week - maybe there is a resistance to the drugs and I am searching for a dopamine hit. I don't know. But it is frustrating. And I can't seem to get out of the funk of whatever it is, for the last month.",1
I'm so fucking depressed it took me three days to find the strength to microwave an instant meal.

I finally found the energy to microwave something so here goes. I miss warm food. I fucking HATE this disease.,1
"It’s so bland. I used to journal a lot - especially about my dreams, because they were always so interesting. I read books while eating meals at home, and could go through three in a month.

Im trying to recover some sense of exercise and I feel like I’m succeeding there, but I’m having a hard time with everything else. I know I want to get back to those things; I really do, but it’s so hard. Has anyone here managed to recover any of their hobbies?",1

I’m having so much self internalized crisis that it’s triggering my seizures. I took a kolonopin last night and it helped a lot but this morning I had another seizure. I have to go to work right now and I’m a hairstylist so I’m worried about being over stressed at work and having one in front of a client or while I’m doing hair, but I’m worried of telling my employer because I don’t want to be an inconvenience.

"If someone could help me out after having read my rent I would he grateful, and if not that's fine as well. Hello people, My life feels at this moment worthless, I wouldn't mind someone taking it away, (at least having said that , that's out of the way). School started again, in my final year now I turned 18, the beginning of the end of school. But because of complications (mental health) I had to redo a year a while ago. All my friends have left now, and I feel very stuck and alone everywhere, in school, with my family, I'm not the person I was during my vacation, I've changed again to the back old stressed and scared me. And I hate it. It's hard because I just don't want any people around me, yet I also feel the need for someone. But I can't bring up the motivation or will power to do so, and I'm in this constant state of not really being there. I don't see any way how to build up a friendship with someone I see at school for example. While I definitely need such a thing. Everyone seems so not on the same level, and I think well that's not gonna work out. Besides that minor stuff stresses me, I'm no longer mindful in any way. I feel so god damn hopeless, and so scared for the future, so immense scared, that I'll fuck up. I can't even go to bed, simply because every part in my brain wants to stay awake, no matter how tired I am, I try to stay awake, until I can't no more, because I've no motivation to fall asleep and start the day over again. I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm still on a waiting list for therapy, and as it seems it will for sure take another month if I'm lucky (most likely 3 months). Everything in me just surches for escapes, it's sleep deprivation, or I grab alcohol, while I pledged to not drink. I can be way more impulsive than normally. It's weird. All this combined with moments of de-realization. I don't know what is going on with me the last week's, but I'll not be able to continue in this way. I feel a stranger in my own body, in this world, with everyone... Could someone please explain me why this all happens. And what could help, or yeah, I don't really know. I don't even know if this is the right place for this post",1
Depression fucking sucks That’s it.,1
"Am I just being melodramatic to feel like you shouldn't tell someone how they ""should"" be coping with their mental health/grief/trauma unless you've been through the same thing? The thing is I would say half the time when I'm having a mental health crisis it's probably quite easy for other people to see that I'm struggling. I can be quite vocal about how I'm feeling as sometimes I feel like it's better to be brutally honest about how you're feeling rather than to not say anything. But the other half of the time when I'm having a mental health crisis tbh it kind of scares me in a way because what happens is that I bottle all my struggles and emotions up then I'll have a breakdown or a fit of emotional burnout/anger but most of the time this happens when I'm in my bedroom with the door shut so obviously no one else is going to know that I've had a breakdown because it's happened behind closed doors. I wouldn't say I'm naturally an irritable or easily angered person, but when someone bottles up their emotions, everyone will explode with a different emotion, for me it's usually sadness and anger. Anger for having a breakdown because it makes me feel weak and sad because it feels like this is a vicious cycle because I bottle my emotions up, then I get more and more tetchy, then I explode, then I feel like I've fucked up because I clearly can't control my emotions very well, then I feel guilty that other people can control their emotions better than I can",1

Is this stress related. So I’m in the process of buying things for my new apartment. It’s my first time moving and I will admit it has been just a tad bit stressful.

"Feeling stressed. I am a healthcare worker and I only moved to my current city last year. I don't have many friends here aside from work friends and a couple friends I met through my boyfriend. Lately, I have felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress. It seems like everyone around me does not care anymore that there is a pandemic going on. With this back and forth of restrictions and uncertainties, many people seem to just be so sick of it and have started to ignore the restrictions and hanging out as normal. Working in healthcare, especially as a frontline worker, I have a hard time doing that. I certainly don't want to be the person to be a super spreader since I work at multiple sites. They typically have gatherings that involve drinking and ending up indoors. I feel like such a prude for wanting to follow the guidelines and just have outdoor gatherings so I don't end up going. I wish I had some friends who are still taking precautions. I understand that it seems like the light at the end of the tunnel seems to be just a glimmer these days but if people stop caring now, won't that just drag things out?? It's not fair that this just prolongs the suffering for those who are actually being careful. Feeling overwhelmingly alone in this lately.",1
"Feel like I'm at breaking point sometimes My whole life is a mess. I am abused by my narcissist parents (who I am also full-time carer for, which makes it all worse). No, I can't leave or get other carers in please just accept that you don't know the whole situation, thank you. My sister (married, 2 kids) never even offers to go grocery shopping (she drives, I don't) for them and when I say to my parents they should ask for her help, they don't want to 'bother' her. Yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is. I get called lazy cos I 'quit my job to scrounge government money, using their disability as an excuse'. They don't refer to me as their daughter, they call me their carer. They treat me like a maid, like staff. Yet when my sister does help, it's with things my parents have refused to let me do. So then they come round on Sunday, do the thing, and I feel like it makes me look so lazy. Then when I make a point 'you said no when I offered to do that', I feel petty. Some bg on my sister - Never got beaten by mom, I did - Never left me alone with her kids - I got to change one diaper when they were babies - Refused to teach me how to drive - Never calls me or invites me to her house - Gives me the general impression she doesn't want me around My mental health has never been great but lately... I am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence. - I have no desire to shower, brush my hair, even change my clothes. - Because of my mental health, I forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless I go without food to do so. They say it's fine but I get that *look*. You know the look. That 'oh, here's the family fuck up again' kind of look. - I drink daily (not loads, just every evening I drink low alcohol wine), this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick, sometimes I am sick - Due to care work I can't take days off, or breaks. Due to lack of support this is even less possible. I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just don't know what to do. I hate my life. I hate myself, and who I have become. This isn't me. I used to be so happy, life of the party, I used to dress up and feel pretty. I look so fat, stressed and tired I loathe catching my reflection these days. I just hate myself. Been to doctor's TWICE (different ones) they don't give a shit. One laughed at me the other said I don't ahve time for your life story, and just shoved tablets under my nose, offering me free counselling which doesn't work.

"ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you? i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad edit holy upvotes. thanks for the awards, and also sharing your feelings with me. it’s nice to know people are experiencing the same thing",1
"I wish my mom wasn't alive so I don't have to feel bad about commiting suicide. I believe suicide is a very selfish thing considering the pain it brings to those around you, and those having to take care of your remains after etc. But I honestly wish my mom wasn't around so that I could kill myself without devastating her. I've thought about ways of suicide that will lead the least amount of sorrow to my mom because I love her. I honestly think it would be better to make it look like an accident, that way she will not have as much guilt. Something like going on a canoe trip(by myself lol), take some opioids and sleeping pills and drown myself idk. I'm so lonely and burnt out on life right now...",1
"Just need to get it off my Chest Hi, I’m lost I am 28 years old. I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), Schizophrenia, Post Traumatic Loss Syndrome and I am Co-Dependent I was homeless between 18 and 22. In that time I walked from one state to another. I was 4 months pregnant with a 32 year old mans baby. That man broke me. He beat me, sold me but he gave me a baby. That baby saved my life. 15 to 19 I self harmed, I wanted to die, I wanted to hate. That baby saved my life. When that baby was 2 weeks old, it clicked. I almost murdered a man, but it clicked. I took my baby and I left. My Incubator betrayed me. They took my baby. I died that day. I kept breathing, I kept existing but I died that day. I have survived since, and I continue to because that Baby still lives. The day may come or It may never come when that Baby will need/want me and I have to be there. Babies grow, and so did I. I owned a home. I owned 2 vehicles. I had a career. I lost it all. I still breathe, I still exist. I am strong, I am a survivor, I CAN do this… Why after all this do I still feel useless… worthless, hopeless… what am I missing to make the hating myself Stop!?",1

"my brother thinks the way I deal with my stress is cool so for the longest time I've dealt with my stress by scratching and picking at my skin, this obviously causes me to have a lot of wounds and scars and I HATE them! I always cover them up with hoodies and long pants (which is terrible because where I live it is super warm) and overall it's not the best experience... my brother recently got a bunch of circular wounds on his arm, I immediately recognized that they were because of scratching because all my wounds are circular too. I asked him why he scratched at his skin and told him about how I hate my skin because I do it and I can't stop. and he replied with ""It's because of stress"" but I know that its not the case because he never did this before I told him how I scratch my skin. I believe It's because he thinks having all these bleeding cuts and scratches is cool and he wants to show his friends that he's 'tough' and other things like that. How should I deal with this and help him (and myself) stop doing this, It's not healthy and I feel really guilty when I look at his arms and I know sooner or later he will get them all over... TL;DR- I always scratched my skin because of stress and after telling my brother about it because It's a problem I face, he started doing it too. I feel really guilty",1
"An unexpected side effect of depression the decline of cognitive capabilities This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more; - an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people - severely reduced attention span - short term memory loss - severely reduced motivation I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence.",1

When people tell me these questions, I just look at them stupidly, because I can't reply ""in a grave, or maybe in a river, maybe the streets ? I have no idea"" These questions hurts, because it make me realize how much a failure I am, and how meaningless and absurd life is. I don't know. I wish I knew what I want to do, but I don't know. I just want to stop this mess.",1
"Yep. I’ve officially lost my mind. I’ve done irreversible damage now. Basically I’m 31 and have a weird fucking relationship with my multi millionaire parents where they will help me survive if I’m on the edge of death, but not actually help me thrive- it’s been this way forever, I am not trying to sound like a petulant manchild (although I get it if you see it that way). I’m homeless right now. But my dad lets me sleep in his workshop in the middle of town. I’ve been here 2 months since I left a sober living where I had a 20 y/o felon as a roommate that was always threatening me. I’ve drank on and off, tonight is on, and I have an extreme rage towards my parents. Words won’t do it justice but my mother is a narcissist Karen at levels you can’t comprehend. I’ve developed anger issues in the past few months after having maintained a relatively calm and cool demeanor through all the bullshit. Well tonight I am just done I guess. I scribbled “That’ll be the last car you ever own”- something my dad said to me when I decided to sell my car when I was struggling financially- behind a plaque hanging on the wall. I have punched a small hole in the bathroom wall. I put a few small cuts on my wrist because I’m too much a pussy to go deeper and just fucking die but I’ve left a blood soaked napkin on the table next to his switchblade. I am done. I am done living this life. I am ready to commit suicide. I just need one more thing to go wrong.",1
"Tragic Surprises of Loneliness... It's hard to be strong, and easy to fall in a hole.

I wrote something that is really how it feels right now and layers of years of depression and avoidance has led to this day. >You know when the electricity goes out unexpectedly - you scramble to try and find your way around the dark, hit walls, and seek the shelter of other companionship regardless of the irrational fear of the dark.

No time to adjust, no time to prepare, just lights out. I seek to find them and say it’s going to be okay, and the electricity will be restored soon. However, no matter how much I look - I can't seem to find anyone around. Lost. Darkness, and longing for the connections I have lost. Yet I can hear them, I can see them, but they are so far away.

"kinda?) finally getting the thai teenager experience. ummm so I'm not sure what to put in the title because it's kinda complicated but I guess what I said works. just a warning that this gonna be a long post also lol. lately i've been making so many new friends. local friends!! i didn't have a lot of local friends previously (people from my country) as i has to cut off people from my old school, and now i am not inside my country's education system either. most of my friends are overseas, my bestfriends are almost 13,000 miles away. i've always wanted to have people i could go hangout with. people with the same timezone to hangout with. people to talk about shit going on here, not ones that i am just explaining the whole situation to, but one that shares an experience. i've first met this friend through a facebook group. i had a post that went viral and he added me. he then commissioned my art. i then found out we're the same age and like a lot of things in common. i was really happy to have a new local friend. he also let me send him happy mail and i made him a rick roll card!! then i joined his discord server and got to meet his classmates. his friends are really nice to me so we soon became friends too. i send them happy mail. i help them cheat on their online exams and their english homework. we have now talked about maybe hanging out at the amusement park when covid gets better. my friend says that i'm like the unofficial 46th student of their class because of how much I interact with everyone. i feel so accepted. its so nice. then i met my friend's other friend. it was actually just a day ago. we hung out and talked on call and it was so fun!! i asked if i could send him mail too and he was really enthusiastic. and told me i can send as much as i want and he will keep a collection. then this new friend introduced me to his gf and shes likes stationery!! she was so excited when i told her i do snail mail. she said she had never done it before and would love to write with me. i was really scared that i would somehow not be able to hangout with these people because of what happened in the past. but now im literally doing nothing but being myself and i am making so many friends!!! i just feel so fucking happy rn. i am making so many new friends. i will get to use thai language more. i could probably even HANGOUT with them in MY COUNTRY now!!! they actually all live in a different province from me, so it's not like i can see them all the time, but it's not super difficult to meet them either. IM SO EXCITED. I FEEL LIKE I AM FINALLY GETTING THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE A LIFE OF A TEENAGER IN THAILAND. I thought I wouldn't have a chance as I'm about to not be a teenage very soon. I have voice calls and video calls to be in all day. Like I've always dreamed of. People are enthusiastic at what I do and I don't have to only care about what they like. It makes me feel so fucking full inside I'm bursting with joy. I know this post was quite long and I maybe didn't even make that much sense but thank you so much for listening to me!! Also, if anyone wants to know what happened about my old friends I can tell you. But only via a letter lol. (i just really like to write letters so i had to say that lmao)",0

"Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified. I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse. While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times. It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.",1
"Im Overwhelmed I think I have too many things going on... maybe idk. Im struggling to manage it all. Im a 3rd year engineering student, but I am only in 4 courses at the moment, the courses are interesting and I enjoy them, but I really struggle to be motivated to study. I used to care, now I expect to fail despite being perfectly capable of achieving high grades and wanting those grades. I live with my bf, who is currently immigrating into Canada via spousal sponsorship, enter a mound of paperwork that is proving to be really challenging. Its stressful because I have to be on him to get it done. He wants to immigrate but is held back by his own insecurities. Things only seem to move forward when I blow up at him (which Ive done recently so he is doing his bit now). Problem is my bit of the paperwork is now overwhelming me because when you have moved 21 times and worked 8 jobs the questions ""where have you lived in the past 5 years"" and "" state your employment history for the last 5 years"" become extremely tedious. I have a job lined up for when I finish this semester in May, I'm excited for it, but they havent told me where I will be (anywhere in Canada) or what I will be doing yet. So thats a lingering worry. I also need to find another job to start in September. I need to buy a car, my job has a 99% chance of requiring one, my parents will pay for it (yes I know I am incredibly lucky and priviledged and Im really thankful to them for being so generous), thing is I have no clue how to buy a car. They are willing to spend up to 10k on it (aiming for the 6-8k range), and I am terrified to drop so much money on a something that I am so inexperienced in purchasing. Also I have a month and a bit to buy it. My brother will be living with me and my bf next year (starting Sept 2020), I need to show him the ropes on how to adult, Im really excites but also scared because I tend to become ""Mom 2"" in these scenarios and that is really not what he needs. Also the process of accelerating his schooling and getting him into uni (he is 16 compressing high school into 1 year) is heavily reliant on my knowledge of both high school and university and my ability to contact people here at the uni. This is not even mentioning his course load which I have decided I just can't help him with because I have too much going on. I'm trying to balance my life, I want to spend time with my bf, brother and friends, but also not completely flop my classes. I want to do fun things, but am scared to. Thing is Im so unproductive, when I study Im slow, I get 1 hour of work done in an entire day no matter what I try. Everyone says to exercise, but thats just another thing on the todo list that never gets done. Also I will not be converted to any kind of mindfullness, Im done with all types of religions. Im so overwhelmed and frustrated. Oh and my taxes are due and i have no clue how to do them. TL;DR I am a young adult that is new to basic things like buying a car and doing taxes, I am overwhelmed by the amount of variables and choices around me and frustrated because I cant seem to be productive.",1
"I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you And this compounds the depression. Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally. And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed.",1
"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets... I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",1
"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared. So, basically, my school is crap. Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today. There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it. However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity"" So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair. He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares. It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest.",0

We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work. I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her.

"Everyone wants to lend a listening ear but nobody wants to lend a helping hand. I don't need to talk I need HELP Every single one of my loved ones are very kind and supportive and I'm glad for that. But all they want me to do is talk? ""Talk to me when you're feeling down. Talk to me when you're overwhelmed by emotions"" But first off, I don't know what to say because my emotions are the same thing over and over - ""I'm a stupid piece of shit and I want to die"". What I really need is ACTUAL PHYSICAL HELP. I can barely bring myself to eat - I need food. I can't get myself out of bed - I need to be dragged out. I am not getting ANY exercise, I need a gym buddy. I can't bring myself to do my chores, I need someone to help me clean. I've told everybody this. Every single person who has said ""I'm here if you need to talk"", I responded with ""what I'm really struggling with right now is getting out of bed and eating"". But nobody is willing to help me beyond listening. And honestly I understand, it's too much to ask to get actual physical help. That's too much time and effort to waste on garbage like me. So I will continue to stay in bed until 4pm. I'll continue to eat nothing. I'll continue to rot away with no hobbies and no motivation to get up and leave or do anything.

"Just Putting My Thoughts Out There I am a PhD student and my concentration is deep learning and signal processing. I think that gives you an idea about why I'm writing this. I cannot focus or concentrate on one thought at a time. Just this morning, I was looking at three things simultaneously and could not do any of them properly. I'm trying to work on image and time series data but, if you are familiar, you know that these are different kinds of signals and require different kinds of processing. Every time I try to focus on any of these two, I constantly think about the other one. I came to machine learning from control systems. I'm just always worrying about what I don't know in machine learning. I don't know enough statistics, multivariate calculus, basic machine learning theories, optimization, natural language processing, image processing, etc. etc. etc. Every time, I'm on my computer, I'm looking at ten different tabs with online courses, the latest papers, and some blogs that always lead to other blogs. The whole world is now working in machine learning and deep learning. I don't know if someone unstable like me can actually make any contribution. My professor is not helping that much because, honestly, I think he is stressed like myself. He doesn't know what he's doing either. I'm supposed to do some groundbreaking work by competing against Google Brain and Facebook Research with zero support and collaboration. Doesn't that sound ridiculous and stupid? I'm feeling like a failure who is worth nothing. All the bad things like imposter syndrome and inferiority complex are my constant companion. I did nothing else in my life except for study. I don't know how to sing or dance or paint. My only outlet is cooking, which I can't do nowadays because I'm moving across the country in a few days and don't want to waste any food. Everyone is flying and I'm just trying to play catch up. I don't know how long I'll be able to keep this charade going... Keep me in your prayers, please.",1

"The day I truly felt like I became a dad So to offer some background, I took up the responsibility of becoming a single parent last year. I had contemplated taking in an older kid not only because I thought I could at least leave them alone during the day when I was at work, but also because I knew how often older kids get passed up in the system for babies, toddlers and young kids. And after getting in touch with my agency, I eventually found out about a kid that was actually my neighbor at one point, having lived in the same apartment building as me. She lived three doors down from me and I remember chatting with her casually a few times because she would just hang out outside her apartment every day. I had no idea she was the victim of abuse from her mother and felt terrible. I remember the day her social worker introduced me to her, I had to remind her of our interactions and once she remembered, she had the biggest smile on her face. Once I took her in and I spent the first week home with her, it went fairly well. There were some bad habits I had to help break, like she used to swear casually just thought it was normal, and some other small things, but we got over it over the proceeding months and she’s been good ever since. I trust, and love, her and she trusts and loves me. So the event in question happened about two months ago. I was going to be gone for a business trip for about three weeks and had to leave my daughter with my brother and my niece and nephew. She didn’t mind staying with them but was understandably upset at the idea of me being gone for so long. She wasn’t having a breakdown or anything, just kind of forlorn and sullen. It broke my heart seeing her like that. But I made sure to make our last night together as memorable as possible and stayed up way later than I should have just for her sake. The next morning, I left and it took every fiber of my being to step outside and leave, but somehow I did. I kept in touch with her and my sister regularly just to make sure everything was going well. Needless to say I hated being gone and wanted nothing more than to hop back in my car and go home. The thing I left for was so needlessly boring and tedious beyond imagining. I mean sure, I liked being with my co-workers and meeting new people, but I would rather be elsewhere of course. Somehow I got through it though and woke up extremely early the next morning and put petal to the metal to get home (don’t worry, I slept enough and wasn’t tired while driving or anything like that). It was like something out of a Hallmark movie because, when I got to my brother’s, she literally burst out of the front door and jumped into my arms, nearly knocking me over. “She acts like I just came home from war or something” I said to my brother and all three of us laughed. This was the moment I truly felt like a dad. Because I was just so in the moment for once in my life and didn’t think about anything else except her and me. It’s that thing where we just look at each other and smile, not saying anything, and we just know how much we care about each other. We touched our heads and even I felt myself cry a little bit. That day in particular was THE DAY for me. And it mad me realize that, for me, the hardest thing about being a parent so far isn’t having to deal with her bad days or stuff at school or any of that. It’s knowing I can’t always be around 24/7. Yes, she has my brother and other family to count on for support and is close with all of them. But the idea of her being gone one day and off to college or wherever she goes frightens me a bit. I know it shouldn’t, but it does. Nevertheless, I try to focus on the here and now as much as I can and do anything and everything for her. If I really had to do it all over again, I would’ve gotten her out of that place and away from her mom much sooner.",0

"I don’t like being a man; I don’t like being me I really don’t know where to post this, but I just need to vent about it. So I went here. I hate everything about my body. I hate all of my body hair. I hate the shape. I hate any shred of masculinity. I’m not supposed to, though. I’m a man, and should be proud of my masculinity and I should act masculine. I hate these expectations. I’m only ever really happy with my appearance—or sometimes in general—when I’m wearing makeup or am feeling feminine. It’s been bugging me so much as of late. It’s been like this my whole life (to varying degrees), but it’s been getting worse and worse recently. I don’t really know what it is or why, but I’m kinda tired of it already. Usually I’m able to pretend like the person in the mirror is someone else, but lately I just can’t. I’m just glad I don’t hate women out of jealousy anymore lmao. I was in deep denial about whatever the fuck this is. If I kinda got through it before, I can do it again. I really wish I was born a woman, though. I’d be a lot more happier in general, I think. This thing isn’t pairing well with my depression and anxiety, either, nor my already pitiful self esteem. I don’t really see a point in life anymore, and it’s all just kinda meaningless to me, yet I care so much about what people think. I just wanna be happy and stay happy for once.

"I'm a masochist I am at the edge. I won't commit suicide but the depression has pretty much taken over my life. My depression is not me. It is a disease. This disease has manifested itself into me discarding self-care. I don't want to buy new clothes for myself, engage in any enjoyable hobbies, or do anything that I would enjoy. I keep putting those things off. Every day for the past... two years, I have been putting off self-care because I'm ""not there yet."" It's this perpetual feeling of inadequacy, of constantly trying to catch up. I think school partially did this to me. I was conditioned into prioritizing work first and foremost. It instilled into me a kind of selflessness. Leisure was relegated to 20 or so minutes of recess/lunch, it wasn't important. This isn't an angsty ""school sucks"" sentiment. I mean it does, but my viewpoint doesn't come from a place of complete directionless anger. I don't want to blame anything for my problems. But the cold truth is that school rewards masochism, which I in part adopted. I tried to escape the stress by procrastinating, which would lead me to missing deadlines which resulted in self-hatred. I had to escape the stress, along with myself. It's funny because I wasn't even that good of a student. What was the point in studying when I'm was and am so unhappy? I am a masochist. I put off happiness because I feel as if I do not deserve it. It makes me feel inhuman. Who would do such a thing? I haven't felt happiness in literal years. Even during moments of leisure I never felt content. I always had to be ""doing something"" because productivity is an instilled and admirable trait. I feel warped. I don't feel human. I let everything pass me by. I'm so fucked up. I won't commit suicide. I can't. But right now, the thoughts are taking full force. I'm so disgusted with myself. That I don't even behave like a normal person. That I'm so compulsive and masochistic and crazy. I have nothing. I am lonely. I am selfless. I just want it all to end. I want to wake up as a normal person. I feel dysphoria with myself as a person. Not gender dysphoria, but the term in a general sense. An unease and deep dissatisfaction with myself. Even when I should be feeling happy, I'm not. Everything just feels so fake and shallow. How can someone like me ever heal if their brain has been wired like this for so long? This chemical imbalance is only getting worse.",1

I don’t understand why I am like this I hate it but every time I get that dream I can only think that it means that I’m going to be gone for good and that I’m no longer important to the only person I have ever loved, If this is sent it’s after I give you the presents and after that I plan to be gone completely, you won’t ever have to hear from me again, and you can live the happy life I know you will have, this is hard to write because I don’t know how you will feel towards me being gone for good, I’ve been trying my best to be helpful to you and trying to make you smile and feel better, when I’m gone though I hope that you are able to be happy and that you take care of the things that are special to me that I gave you. This is already long enough I don’t even know if you will read all of this through but if you did I loved you and you brought me almost all of my happy memories, I don’t know if you think I was a bad boyfriend or not and that most of our relationship was bad because it wasn’t it was the funniest and the best thing in my life and I hope that you can remember me with the good memories of us when I’m gone especially the ice skating one that is the most special memory I have of us besides when we first became a couple and our first kiss. Well If I’m still here after I sent this text then I’m sorry. I always wished I could have married you and started a family with you but life’s not fair so thank you for the good memories and showing me the happiness that I thought I would never had, I know you regret a lot of things with me and I hope by the time I send this that we would have made amends and you forgave me if not then at least me being gone will be easier for you to move on and not feel bad or guilty when you think about me, I hope you care for the gifts because they will be the last things you get from me I don’t know if I will send this maybe before a hangout with everyone or maybe after so I could hangout with you one last time and see your smiling face.",1

"The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all” When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them.

Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale. Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life. Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

I've got a really demanding job that recently has been piling up with more and more stress. My department was gutted and I'm basically the last one standing - doing the work that 4 people used to do. On top of that, I'm doing a full time accelerated MBA which, until this point, I've been able to handle. Here's where it get's stupid.. I volunteered for a really exciting extra-curricular project and got accepted (yay!). It's a huge initiative and requires hours and hours of reading. The people in my group are incredibly experienced and well versed on the topic (Think Managing Directors/Corporate Sustainability Directors etc) and I feel way out of my depth amongst them, let alone contributing. I've been practicing yoga 5 days a week which helps, and developed an obsession with incense but my mind is constantly running. On top of all of this - the breakup has left me stressed emotionally and financially and I don't have a car to even to my groceries. To go shopping I have to lug around huge bags on either arm and walk 20 minutes to and from the shops, often in muggy and horrible weather. I know a lot of it is self-induced. The extra-curricular, the MBA, the demanding job, the break up.. but it's beyond the point of return. I can't drop one or any of these stresses. I can't keep on top of everything and feel like the only thing that relieves me is yoga - but I have to do yoga in my lunch break and then I miss out on eating and am stressed that people at work are gossiping because my lunch breaks often go beyond an hour (Due to getting changed, walking to the studio etc). I needed to type that out. Thanks guys. ",1
"I'm losing hope I'm only 19, so I have a lot ahead of me. Honestly I never thought I'd make it this far so I'm very lost on what to do. Recently my nieces were taken from their mother. The reason being something very bad, but WE (my parents, me and my brother who has autism) have absolutely nothing to do with the reason they were taken away. CPS is doing all they can to keep them from us. My parents, their grandparents, have been through court for a whole year now. CPS is making lies, they're harassing us, and just being plain mean to us with rude remarks. The case worker admitted in court that she has no intention of letting us get the girls back, and that she even had no reason for why. How could someone do this??? The foster mom doesn't even want the girls it seems. The foster brother (adopted) bullies the girls, and they're always at daycare instead of with the foster mom. The foster mom wants to adopt them, and then move a few states away. My parents are giving up on trying to get custody. I practically raised these girls. I love them so much. I'm crying typing this lol. It makes me want to give up. How can people be so mean in this world? How can you take children away from their family and be fine with it? How am I supposed to cope with losing them? Because of them, I wanted to actually live and now they're gone. I don't know what to really do anymore.",1
Help please It started about 2 months ago. I had my first panic attack. Ever since that day I have been stressing NO MATTER WHAT. I'm scared of everything. I cry almost every night about what's going to happen. I really need help. I'm only a freshman in school but I feel like I'm a 40 year old man struggling to pay and feed his kids. I really need something to help. Should I seek mental help. My parents are thinking about talking me to my local psychiatrist. I need someones advice still please help me however you can. I'm going to post this on multiple subs.,1

"I wish someone would kill me for me I hate how all it takes is one messy week for me to go from “yeah life is whatever” to wishing that every car I passed on the street would run me down.

"High functioning depression is so easily over looked I try and do anything and everything all day. I can't be alone with my thoughts so my objective is to do as much as I can to keep busy. Every evening I'm exhausted, emotionally drained and still depressed. I feel like I'm beating back a relentless force. I feel like I've been robbed of being proud of the little things I do like washing my face or baking because I do that anyway so it's not like I can be proud of the effort I've put in. My biggest fear is waking up and not having anything to do, just be in my head. Fortunately I'm able eat, brush my teeth and do things every day and to the outsider I look like I'm doing really well but I'm struggling a lot. Before this there was a year of staying in bed and not doing anything but now that I'm doing things everyday I feel even more hopeless. It's proof that even if I'm proactive in my life I feel as shit as I would if I did fuck all.",1

"The cancer has spread to my liver Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again. Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel. Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways. Edit I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock. You all are so nice and lovely...it definitely helps the ol psyche when so many people affirm that I'm allowed to be upset. So thank you, to everyone who has commented or upvoted, these little moments of support help so much sometimes. Thank you.",1

"Too depressed to be productive, and not depressed enough to kill myself I lowkey wish I can be pushed over the edge so I'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)",1
Does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt The worst part is now I have a girlfriend that I’ve dating for a while and I’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those I care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy,1
"Severe anxiety, derealization, agoraphobia, depression... Hello good people, I hope u are having a great day, and u will have the patience to read my post. I'm not native english speaker, so I apologize in advance if I make some errors. I am writing this post, which is more like a cry for help, during a time when I feel like I touched the bottom of life. I have struggled with anxiety pretty much my whole life, without knowing it in my childhood, everyone around me, as well as myself, thought that I was just a shy and insecure kid. Everything started very early in my childhood, I was around 6-7 years old when I had to go to school, but could not do it, and in many different occasions I felt very anxious and started having derealization, which I had no idea what it was back then. I would have go home when I felt it and it was going away. Always when I had to do something new, or something where I felt uncomfortable I got anxiety and sometimes derealization. Almost never I could go on a vacation, or on an excursion and relax and enjoy it fully like everyone else, the feeling was so strong that I almost always had physical symptoms, I would feel sick, or had to go to the bathroom and my whole body was stiff, could never fully relax. My whole life I was involved with sports, and this mental issues prevented me from giving my 100% in sports. Things got better when I was around 12 years old, I had many friends, I felt very comfortable in school, had a lot of fun and almost the whole day I was outside with my friends, playing and having fun, so all this mental issues were reduced significantly, life seemed normal again. But then, when I had to start in high school everything changed, I lost almost all of my friends (they went in different schools and everyone found new friends) and I could not go to school anymore, I could not adapt and the anxiety went through the roof, so I started isolating myself at home. Btw I live in a third world country, so not going to high school is punishable, u have to pay a very big fine. So the people at the school, and some relatives, tried to scare me, saying that my family was going to pay a big fine etc, but this made me even more angry. After this, life never really returned to normal, I spent most of the days at home or in the house of my grandparents, had no close friends and never have been in a relationship in my life. But I was feeling very comfortable at home at the beginning but very soon it took its toll. I developed OCD (again without knowing what it was), I'm sure many of u are familiar with this term and know what it is. I struggled with it for many years afterwards, plus the severe anxiety. I managed to solve it (OCD), pretty much completely, on my own. And then the life gave me the biggest punch. First, my grandpa, with whom I was very close, got sick and died, which had an incredibly big impact on me and 2 months later my father had a stroke, which fortunately he survived and recovered from completely but the trauma that I went through was very big. In those times I had almost no emotional support, I was pretty much left on my own, to go through that period. I did not want to bother my mother to console me, because I did not want to show any weakness in those times, when she was too devastated by that event. So I went through all that period with my head held up high and then when it all settled, the s\*it hit the fan. Severe anxiety, OCD and derealization came back. The derealization became so strong (and it still is) that I cannot fight it, every time when I leave my room.After that I started having panic attacks which led very fast to agoraphobia. Now, for the last 5 months I'm almost everyday, 24h in my room with very little human contact. I take a shower rarely, and sometimes it feels very difficult even to change my clothes. So far in my life I have been on 3 different medications, and Ive seen many psychologists/psychiatrists, including hypnotic therapy, but the anxiety seems to have won against everything. I was very religious pretty much my whole life, going to church, praying but now I know that I completely lost my faith. The most beautiful thing that happened to me in the last few years is the girl that I met few weeks ago online (she lives in a neighbouring country) and I immediately felt connection, and now can say for sure that I felt in love, after many many years, and it seems that the love is returned. But on the other hand, what makes me sad, and I write this with tears rolling down my face, is the fact that with all this mental issues I cannot make her happy, I cannot have a normal life, even though she says that she loves my company. Suicidal and self-harming thoughts have been regular in the past few months along with the depression. I lost interest in many things that I loved. I think I said enough, I opened my heart and I don't even know why I did it but maybe somebody can relate and give some help or maybe this post of mine is going to be helpful for other people. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this, and I really hope that all of you struggling with mental issues will find a solution and get your life back.",1
"I wish I was a fucking amoeba No stress, no depression, just vibing while I consume nearby prokaryotes and shit. Deadlines? There are no deadlines, only mitosis. Lonely? Fuck it, I'll just make another me and we'll be best pals as we swim around in primordial soup. Humanity was a fucking mistake, I want to return to amoeba where I belong.",1
"How do you get over overthinking??? Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always overthought. If I make a mistake, I’ll think about it for days, which turn into weeks, and sometimes months. For example, about a week and a half ago I picked up my friend and her cousin and went to the mall and I accidentally took the exit incorrectly (there was traffic cones and shit), and I still think about because I’m so embarrassed. The moment keeps replaying in my head and I keep coming up with solutions to the situation. Like, what if I killed us 3? What if I hurt other people exiting? What if everyone’s scared of driving with me again? What if I hit someone, or someone hit me? What if there wasn’t any road right there? What could’ve happened because of my stupidity? Like Im just so fucking annoying and stupid and dumb. I hate me bro. I’ll think about things that happened years ago and it’ll be on my mind for the longest time until I just simply forget. Sometimes when I get the thinking and get annoyed in a way, and I slap my head. As if I can slap the thought out of me. It stresses me out so bad. Sometimes I just wish I could just die so I won’t have to think at all. My thoughts eat away at me. My friend kept yelling at me last night, and the more she did, the more sadder I got and kept overthinking that I was an annoying pest and they didn’t want me around. I kept calling people to say Happy Halloween and both my friends kept yelling. And I know they meant it innocently, but now I just can’t/won’t stop thinking about it. I just know it. I just don’t know how to stop thinking. And I need help. How do I stop overthinking? What can I do?",0
lymph nodes can stress and or anxiety cause lymph nodes to swell. i have one in my neck that had been there for like 4 months now and it hasn’t grown or anything just feels like a pea i can feel it but you can’t see it. it just feels like a pea or smaller. i went to the doctor all they said was to watch it.,1
Anyone else feel like they're just scraping through each day to make it home and return to your vicious cycle habits?

"I don’t really know what to title this? I’m really new to Reddit so please let me know if I’m somehow doing this wrong! So, obviously based on the topic, I suffer from depression and anxiety and have done since I was a kid. I lived with my mum until I was 13 and suffered neglect and slight emotional abuse while living with her which obviously was the trigger for the anxiety and the depression. I’m mostly good now, I’m on medication and I’ve been seeing a counsellor at uni for most of my degree but sometimes I think about my childhood and get a bit of an ‘oof’ feeling over smaller things. Which is what’s brought me here, because of neglect from my mother I have bad oral hygiene. Growing up she never really encouraged me to be clean and stuff, so I was never told that I had to brush my teeth in the morning and evening, because of this brushing my teeth isn’t something I remember to do, and the importance of good dental hygiene was never something I was taught. And as simple a thing as it sounds, it’s one of the main things that stuck with me as a kind of memory from growing up in a neglectful environment. I really struggle with remembering to brush my teeth, and I don’t feel like asking my friends or flatmates to remind me to brush my teeth is really an option. I’m not sure if this made much sense or if it’s allowed here, but I just wanted to get it off my chest",1
"Eh,I don't know what to call this, I'm just waiting for my death So, well I have a background of 7 years of trauma but I used to be a top student to give you context. The problem is there's nothing I can do in life, there's things I love to do but can't pursue as a career because I'm not really THAT GOOD or so I believe and will get no support from my family. So I have decied I'll just Do BTech and shit because I have nothing that I feel like is for me. With covid my habit of studying is just extinct and I want to maintain my grades but of course I'm miserably failing, I don't understand why I can't just study like normal people, I hate that if I don't change things will only get worse,my exams are in a week and I keep getting more and more drained because i don't know crap. I do not know what the meaning of life is. When I was younger I was happy to be a good hardworking student but now I'm nothing, I don't have friends to go out and have with I just watch people living life and for me every day is so draining I don't know why I was born, I wanted to study abroad but it's just not possible for me and I just came to know that yesterday so,I mean my hopes are like fucking shattered with life, whether it's in social or like student life ,I do nothing. It's like I'm trying to do something with my school but I can't and right now I can't even explain what I'm trying to say, it's just I wish I would die because there's nothing I want to do in my life. It's a fucking waste,I'm a waste. I don't even know what life is supposed to be. I have lost my identity and I am just numbing myself. All I do is use my phone and distract myself. I just don't know what to do. I wish I could just devote myself to books. I also wish I wasn't an abnormal piece of shit. I mean what can anyone expect from me who can't even express myself properly, whatever I'm writing right now even that feels a waste I just don't know. Fuck this why can't I just die There's no point on why I'm living, I wish I can be saved because life is so pointless to me, the frustration I'm feeling right now because I can't get this boulder of miserable feelings even when I'm trying to write it. Why can't I die , I feel like my life is gonna be miserable anayway. I just,I don't know I wanna be the perfect person I was back in 2015, I hate this abomination I have become. Maybe this post goes unseen and I think that's what it deserves,I'm nothing after all. Anyone who was reading though, thank you for listening to me struggle to express myself which I still can't ,but you have my sincere thanks and sorry for the time you won't get back reading this.",1
"I am fully aware of my flaws and I know what's holding me back, but I don't have even remotely enough willpower or energy to fix them and get my life together. I've had the solutions to most of my problems handed to me on a silver platter, but I'm too stupid and weak to accept it and start the long journey to recovery. I feel like it's a lost battle, I've given up on life before i even started, so many people tried making me understand that I was heading towards misery, but I didn't listen, and like a driver who falls asleep at the wheel, my life is now a complete wreck and it's going to be 20 times harder for me to get back on track with a demolished ""car"". I just want to lay in bed and die.",1
Work has been stressful all year I’m a postman and most people think of it as an easy going job. It was once that way many years ago but it was privatised about 15 years ago (Royal Mail). I know I’m not the only one struggling at the minute. But I feel like I’m doing so shit compared to everyone else. With absences cause of covid and everyone ordering for Christmas it’s been a nightmare often working 50 hour weeks from a usual 28. It’s not even only that but I am pretty sensitive type and I feel like I’m fucking up more than anybody else. When I feel useless at something I just want to give up. It’s only my girlfriend pushing me through at the moment. I know it’s childish to just want to quit when things go wrong but I feel on edge atm. I’m going to end up letting down a lot of customers who are waiting for their parcels because I’m not quick compared to the others,1

"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere. Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable. Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain. Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left. I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have. PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight ) Edit Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning )",1

I don’t know if I should ask I have been diagnosed for a bit with anxiety and depression. I know this is a bit of a stretch but I think I have ADHD or something similar.

I’m so fucking close to dropping out. I can’t fucking stand school anymore I’m a senior in hs and I’m suppose to graduate this yr but I need an English credit and currently I have 4 days to write a 9 page essay. It isn’t in the grade book with how many points it is worth. I have a 72% now so this is probably gonna make or break my grade. my final is only worth 10% of my grade but I need at least a 62% to for sure pass. I’ve done the outline on my paper but still haven’t gotten a grade and I turned in the topic I chose twice and still haven’t gotten a grade. Mind you these were turned in dec. 19th and last Friday. Now I’m sweating bullets about getting this thing done because I spent all last week catching up on web design and this week 3 of my finals start plus I have to turn in mandatory study guides before I can even take the final. The thing that’s mostly stressing me is my parents are counting on me to be the first to graduate and I don’t wanna let them down but this paper is so difficult it took me a week alone to get the outline done and now I’m sitting her procrastinating. I don’t wanna get a bad grade on it but I don’t wanna not do it and it fucking sucks.,1
"I just got lost in the woods on purpose just to feel something Didn't tell anyone where I was going and just drove to an area with a big forest.

I eventually found my way out, but for a while there I was actually lost. Felt good I guess to feel a hint of danger.",0
"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free. After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around. And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday. Edit Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. ",1

"Loving someone with depression, anxiety I'm a person that suffers from both of these from a very young age. I know how difficult it can be. And I know its even more difficult to love someone in this condition. Because you need to be patient. Especially if the person you're dating had an abusive past. You need to try your best to stay calm and listen to what they have to say. It takes lot of time and effort for someone in this condition to learn to be themselves around you without having to hide the breakdowns and all the other stuff. It takes time and it takes trust. So if you can't love someone like this, my advice is to leave because they've already been through enough. I didn't mean to offend anyone, its just my point of view about this situation.",1
"I'm almost 28 and i have wasted my life In a few months i will 28 and i have wasted my life. I have never had a job, a girlfriend, or a close friend. I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice. I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me. My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself. I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i cant believe i let this happened. I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college. I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy. I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life. Edit. I never thought my post would get this much attention. I watched a youtube about suicidal thoughts and the guy said reddit helped him so i thought i would give this a try.I thank you all for the comments",1
"Am I (28F) Actually Depressed? I often have to think about how meaningless existence is, about how we're all going to die and there is no escape from it. How the universe and everything we know is going to end and all that is, is actually ephemeral and vain. These thoughts haunt me to the point of getting really anxious. I try to tell myself that it doesn't matter and what matters is enjoying the limited time we all have here on Earth, but then I look around think about global warming, endless wars and struggle to find meaning in a meaningless world and I just can't be happy. My whole life I have been looking for something more than just average normal life, but then I think, we all are looking for the ""more"" but the more never comes. People who ain't depressed are just people who realize it first and adapt to the nothingness of everyday. I don't want to adapt, I don't want to burn out. I keep on telling myself that what really matters in my life and what makes me different from others is that I have a passion, I have visions, I have true feelings, I have a flame that keeps me alive, but also that makes me desperate for something greater than life itself. But there is nothing greater and everything leaves me feeling dissatisfied.  I still fight, 'cause otherwise, it just wouldn't make sense for me. I work a lot, 'cause I want to be one of the best in my field. I create a lot, because I want to be successful as an artist. I exercise a lot, 'cause I want to be the one with the best body. I read a lot of books, 'cause I want to be the smartest person in every room. I debate people, 'cause I want to show everyone that I have ides and opinions. I spend hours preparing before going somewhere, 'cause I want to be the best looking one everywhere I go. Being avereage is simply a waste of existence for me. Whenever I work on myself, get productive, creative, set goals, my depression gets a tiny bit better. After all, it always comes back, but that makes me even more drown to be productive and competetive. In the end of the day, when everything is quiet and I am at home with partner and he tells me that he loves me, I realize that I do not feel anything much and the thirst for the more becomes almost unbearable. I can't calm myself, I often have to use alcohol to get rid of anxiety over dying and feeling endlesly bored and empty. Then I need to escape the real world and get lost in my imagination about life that I could have had in a different reality. I can stare at the wall for hours imaging a different kind of life for myself. The thing is no matter how hard I try to get it, I never feel good about myself or anything really.  I am at that point where I think having children is an act of horror. Existence is a painful dissatisfying torture and I would never put another being through the hell of human life. At the same time, I know that all I have to do is keep trying and working and even harder and harder and harder to become the perfect version of the perfect me.",1
"Don't know how to live, it's difficult to go on... I wish for this to be over soon. I wish to die. Everyday. Every minute. If I were to die this moment, I would be the happiest person at the moment. Because it'll be over. But it would be terribly selfish of me to die before my mother. She won't be able to bear it. She would, she has three more children, but I'll cause sorrow.... And so, it must be me who suffers. It's hard. I feel sorrow for no reason. Then, there are reasons which I try to avoid. I don't know what to do, how to keep on breathing.",1
"I was looking at this place for the last 20 min and i might as well share what's bothering me. I do not think i am depressed. I do not self diagnose with depression. At points i think i am pathetic and making myself feel bad just because i am bored. One moment i can be with a pillow over my face trying to science my crying , the next i am thinking everything is okay and i am just being dramatic. For context. I am a guy in highschool. I am Bulgarian and my parents have been divorced for roughly half my life and a bit longer at this point. That's all the info i am giving out for now. This summer has probably been the worst one for me. back in 2019 i was spending my 1st month of summer break watching anime and playing games , after that my ex who i have known for 8 years (more so knew as we are on bad terms now) Introduced me to a friend of hers and we started going out nearly daily. Out friend group slowly grew as we moved to highschool we are about 15 people at one point and that was probably the best time of my life. in the coming months our friend group became smaller and smaller and by summer 2020 it was only 8 of us. By October it was only 4 of us and by the end of October i was alone. I went form having a ton of friends to basically having no one , i got closer with one of the 4 people and we are now pretty good friends and helped me get a new friend group. But even with a new friend group this summer i haven't gone out with anyone... Since June the 30th i haven't hung out with anyone. Barely anyone has texted me and i feel alone as shit. I have just been gaming and watching anime. Thankfully i met my girlfriend back in May but she lives all the way in the USA so my hopes of ever meeting her are pretty low. But she helps me to keep on moving on at points. I really do hope that life will get better as i grow older but i feel like i will never be happy again as the current person i am. I feel like i fucked up in this life and i envy anyone who has a nice friendgroup. There was this one tiktok of 3 girls cosplay characters form Chainsaw man and just hanging out. It's unreal how jealous i felt of people who were having fun together. I wish that when i am older i will be able to hang out with people i like and go places i wanted to go to with my gf but at the same time i have been crying nearly every night the last week thinking about how i am stuck in this country without anyone. I am very sorry that this post is such a mess , i just really needed to vent as i don't want to bother people who i game with and people that usually see the so called happy and positive side of me. Is there any advice that you would give me so that i could atleast be a little more hopeful of the future ?",1
"Just ranting I just joined this subreddit and haven't looked into coping mechanisms yet, but anyone who has tips on how to handle stress, please share. I just need to get these stressors off my chest. 1) Had a baby 3 months ago. That shits hard. 2) Toilet fucking exploded and our roof leaked, pretty much destroying our house. 2 a) My house has been in shambles for 2 months 2 b) they've finally started working on my house, which means me, the baby and the dog have to be out from 7am to 7pm. 2 c) being out of the house means being with my parents, my sister, my baby, 3 dogs and a bird in 1 house 2 d) even with 20k from insurance, were paying 50-60k in repairs 2 e) dog is reactive and is stressed/struggling with being out of our home 3) fucking pandemic. Province just shit down again, can't see my friends or extended family. 4) Grandma passed away in October because of cancer. Other grandma is dying of cancer. My husband's grandma also has terminal cancer. 5) to top it off, I found out today my care wheel needs to be replaced. Not the biggest deal, just the icing on the cake. This stress has cause myself and my husband to feel overhwelmed and depressed, which has taken a serious toll on our relationship. I feel like in a few months things may be better, but I'm just in over my head right now.",1
"Not sure what I'm doing with my life... M(28) I'm just after some kind words from people who have been through a similar situation. I graduated from design school when I was 18, got my diploma. Managed to get an average design job for a few years - I enjoy design, I'm very creative. After a year and a half at this job I end up moving to the other side of the world with my now ex girlfriend. I couldn't get a job within design there because of language difficulties. My gf told me I need to keep working on my portfolio, but was too lazy/ had no inspiration. I managed to get a job working at a crap company in retail and have been there for a year - going nowhere. I also managed to get a tattoo apprenticeship at a small studio - I was there for a year, I was doing really well - until I had a disagreement with the owner and I left. I enjoy tattooing but I'm so impatient, I want things to move quickly and become pro asap... I've now broken up with my gf of 5+ years and have decided to move back to the other side of the world to start again. I have so many jobs/ professions in my head that I want to get into but I'm unsure as to what it is.... I'm so stuck! I feel like a failure. I just want a job that I'm happy at, make good money etc I understand this is a fairly confusing post but if anyone has any advice on how to better focus on what kind of job to get into - I'd be greatly appreciate it!

"I think stress is leading to a serious decline in my mental health In short, I go to a very stressful and rigorous school. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem, but because of COVID and my already poor mental health it has left me very stressed pretty much all of the time. Even though I was mentally ill before this, I was mostly just depressed and very sad. But now, I am experiencing things like constantly feeling dirty, dissociating, and having severe and very vivid nightmares. I am also having constant flashbacks of very negative memories that I can’t seem to get out of my head. I am supposed to go to therapy every week, but because of my school schedule I only go once a month, and sometimes even less frequently than that. I am really not sure what to do. I feel like school is cutting off my ability to get help or do anything that I enjoy, which would greatly reduce my stress.",1

"My parents forced me to get a job at age of 14 When i was 14 my parents told me to get a job and make money.

After 3 days i quit that job because i was feeling so bad. I came home and my parents started to making fun of me and tellin me im so soft. I cant hold a simple job. Honestly that work was so hard carrying so many heavy stuffs that would hurt your physical health. After that summer all my bad feeling started. I felt like im worthless, soft, i dont have any confidence/self steem. 2 years passed and now im 16. This summer i found a job at a cafe like place. It was full time 12hrs job. I worked for 5 days i had that feeling again. ""Im just 16 why the fuck my life should be like this work from 9am to 10pm for a shitty salary, get home, take a shower, sleep and repeat"" i quit again. Now they're making fun of me again.

"how do i see a psychiatrist over the past 6 years, i often experience some phases lasting a few weeks to a few months and during those periods i can't control my own emotions, i get annoyed by every small thing and i keep crying throughout the day. i also shut my friends out and don't feel like talking to anyone. my appetite is also horrible and i don't eat a bowl of rice per day. however, it doesn't really affect my work and i'm kind of a workaholic, so people around me think i'm normal (hopefully). i also always feel anxious and have had a few attacks. recently, i sought help from a local non-profit organization and i've been going for free counselling for a year. sometimes it helps but sometimes it doesn't, so even though i'm slightly better at managing these phases, it still happens and affects my daily life. my friends are forcing me to see a psych because they think i should get a diagnosis and meds and a part of me wants to because i want to get better but a part of me doesn't want to because i feel like it's a waste of money and it's going to be very difficult to convince my parents (i'm 17 y/o, singaporean). i can't go by myself because i'm broke but my parents wouldn't bring me because they aren't even willing to bring me to a doctor for my physical issues (i'm experiencing nerve pain in my leg and if it continues i think i might become cripple). any issue/sickness i have, they tell me to drink water and take a walk in the park as if that will make me magically feel better. my parents fight multiple times everyday since i was young and there was a point of time they wanted to divorce and i think it has affected me so i always try to handle my own things myself. i'm also used to feeling depressed and anxious because i've been dealing with it just fine (maybe not) for the past 6 years. i'm thinking of telling my parents one more time but if it doesn't work i'll have to starve, save up and go by myself at a later time. i honestly don't know what to do at this point, i'm so lost. i feel like a crazy person, sorry that this post is all over the place.",1

What depression actually looks like. Playing a WoW vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed. Staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon. Scrolling through your Facebook timeline and wondering who these people are. Earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food. Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack. Wondering why you still have these problems at 30. Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship. Never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you.,1

"People making me feel good about myself all of a sudden! I never had many friends. I'm an introvert and have the kind of face that apparently makes me look unapproachable and arrogant. I'm neither. I'm just shy as hell. I don't have many friends. I have very few but close friends, the kind I can trust with my life and vice versa, but all of them live hours away. So in the city I live in, I have only colleagues or acquaintances. Yet in the last 7 days, 3 people I would have considered long time acquaintances at best have contacted me and asked me to hang out. They don't know each other, so it must be one weird coincidence. I went out with all of them, had drinks (which I know can make me weird) and Every. Single. One of them. said they'd like to spend more time with me/ hang out more often / play video games / go to the theatre etc. I NEVER had anyone show any genuine interest in me ever before unless I had reason to assume they tried to manipulate me (e.g. I look epic in my new dress the sudden male interest clearly has nothing to do with my shining personality) and am a bit overwhelmed. Even tonight I went out and started chatting to random people, and met a Brazilian author (I'm a librarian so books are my thing) who not only signed me his most recent work (""to my new stunningly beautiful friend who I hope will one day go out with me"") but kept complimenting me.

"I got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment? Last week I received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment. It was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard, each student is signed in with their student number. That at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it because I came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when I did not plagiarise. The email required me to have an interview with three people, tutor, unit coordinator and an observer (but I am not obliged to go, but I did anyways). The email notified me to bring the person I plagiarised off from.. but the thing is I actually don't know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone? I did call them up and said I did have a friend to GUIDE me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all, basically does a different course completely, same uni but different campus. So fast forward to the date of the interview I was pretty confident of clearing my innocent, I brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name? I blurted out who's that by accident. So during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons, only one question consisting ABC were exactly the same!!! HOW UNCANNY?? The thing is, that was only like 10% of the assignment. I do understand their point of view, out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers. So some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how I got the working out for these questions, my dumbass really did guess it but I was able to explain how I got it, the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong AND plagiarised it. But my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PLAGIARISE? I did say I got them off the lecture notes but I really have no idea how I have the same answers as the other person. Anyways, during the interview, they were trying to throw my friend and I under the bus to admit to at least cheating, which we did not. All assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only. They were trying to imply I was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions. They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc) and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room, I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject). I NEED TO STUDY.",1
"I am so happy!!! Today I officially left school for good. I did my 12th grade like I was meant to do and I love the me that finished it When I was 17 I got a very deep depression and had to leave school due to bullying. with alot of therapy and my mom help I got into the night school to complete the 9th grade. Did 2 years and I finished it all except for math. Had to do another year in another school just for that. Then I decided to do night school again for the 12th grade for 3 years. It was the time of it. I went to literal hell in this past years for it and never felt better. I had to deal with a narcisistic mother, a family that blamed me for something nasty I didn't ask for, , a suicide attempt, losing jobs I wanted, unemployment, had to deal with idiots, my own depression that still makes me stay in the couch all day, and a freaking pandemic. This school year my job let me go and I decided to go get my yearly social security checks and stay home to study and rest. I almost failed the second year but turned it around and was actually the 1st one to finish everything. This year I made question of doing the same. Had an intership also that I finished with a 17 score! And the lady of the intership told me I might get a 9 month internship in another hotel cause she sees me with a great future! Did 2 school events with my class but I got to take the rains (misspelled I know xp) 6 years ago I was depressed and didn't left my house and never thought I could do much. Now I am 24 and feel like I can do almost anything I put my mind into and I an in therapy and trying to be the best me I can be. My next battle will be losing weight and move out! )",0

I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply.",1
"can't focus this year is my major exams. I just came back from a long school holiday but I feel drained. really drained. I can't think straight, I'm making mistakes during homework. I have tried playing a game of call of duty but just seem to continue being bothered. Im constantly worrying which deprives me of sleep. The major exams thing is just bugging me. I even started on more enrichment classes to help to stop me from worrying even more. The only time I wouldn't worry is with my best friend. But I just feel my teachers wouldn't allow me to be seated with him. He distracts me from all my worries. With my schedule being so packed now, I don't know if I can spend time with him. idk what to do now. thanks for listening me rant",1
"Managing stress when checking blood pressure Hi, I suffer from hypertension. I'm currently taking medication for it and I check my blood pressure everyday. I have good days and bad days, however they're mostly bad when I'm stressing. I usually always start to stress when I need to check my blood pressure which causes it to spike so I usually check it quite a few times when I start to calm down. Sometimes breathing techniques have helped to lower it, but other times I still have trouble. Is there anything else I can do to avoid these stress spikes?",1
"Living is exhausting. I am so used at distracting myself with things around me because if I never did, I would probably get sad a lot. And so life gets tiring. My day-to-day scene is just me working, trying to drown myself with work so I won't be reminded of how sad I am living my life is. But the thing is, my body is so used to being sad, that when good things finally start to happen, in some ways, life has its way of attacking me with shit. And that;s when being happy is scary because you know that bad things come after. And that was tiring a lot.",1
"Gifting my ex, after all the shit we went through? Hey Reddit. I have a stupid idea but I might go for it. I'm gonna offer my ex money. I can afford it, and maybe it could help him in his situation. Because of his situation, he is considering suicide - at least if you can trust his latest post on this page. We just broke up and it was a bad breakup. I decided I would cut him off completely and not reply no matter what. He did some efforts to reach me and I ignored him for 3 days. Last night he messaged me saying that I could talk to him if i needed to, and i replied today (because of my intentions.) I decided to drop my ego but I'm stressed out waiting for a reply because my gut feeling says that he won't reply, as a payback. Now i don't even know if his suicide plan is real but it worries me A LOT. It could be a dirty trick to get my attention or he just meant to say goodbye for the last time. I don't know for real, that also stresses me out. Thinking about him makes me feel extremly bad. Contacting him feels completely wrong, but the reason i even wanna give him these money is because i care about him, i did promise to help him out and also that i want to be a good person that keeps her promises.",1
"White hair due to stress Hi everyone, I really want to hear if anyone has had experiences with white hair due to stress and if it will go away. I am only 23 years old and this year has been extremely stressful for me, and I started to notice a lot of white hair. When I say a lot I don’t mean like 5 hairs, I mean like a LOT. I started to notice small strands that are completely white, and honestly that caused me a lot more stress on top of it. I’m hoping Hearing other’s experiences will help me feel a bit better.",1

"Feeling stressed like never before I’m in college and I have a light load of classes, especially considering loads other students have. It’s insanely difficult for me to keep up while working 35 hours a week, but I have no choice. I need the money. This week I finally got myself out of a depressive episode enough to get work done since I had some extra time off work this week. I was doing good. But I got into a car accident early in the week and I’ve just been so insanely fucked up mentally ever since and stressed about the financials of fixing my car that I have missed several major assignments in a class I was already super behind in. It’s math, a subject I struggle in enough as it is, and I just can’t seem to catch up. I requested less hours at work so I’m only going to be working 20-25 hours a week but my professor just gives so much homework and shrugs me, specifically, off. I don’t want to fail this class. I turn everything in late even if I know it’s taking a good chunk of my grade off but fuck. I’m exhausted and can’t sleep, I have no appetite (I have eaten maybe one proper meal in the last 4 days), and I just feel like I’m at my breaking point and literally nobody understands. Everyone just says “haha me too college sucks zany_face ” but I’m at a point I wish I just don’t wake up in the morning. I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I’m drowning.",1
"I've lost motivation and I'm not sure what to do. Okay, so recently I've found myself not doing anything, I'll just sit around and do basically nothing for hours. Is there a way to move past this? More and more I find things I once enjoyed don't interest me and I'm losing all motivation to even leave my room. I've spoken to doctors and I've been told that I've got really bad stress and anxiety but I'm not sure why I'm stressed and I fear that's contributing to my stress. Does anyone have any ideas on help?",1
"Is anyone so stressed about their job they are more stressed at home anticipating it than actually at work? I’ve been at my new job for a little over a month, and still am trying to learn everything right. My manager is very unpredictable in his moods and impatient which makes it hard to ask questions or ask what my next task is. When I make any kind of mistake he can make me feel terrible about it. Because of this I get home and just worry about how much I will have to interact with him the next day and mistakes I might make in front of him. Does anyone have similar experiences?",1
"Facial pain due to stress? I've been having gastrointestinal issues for a few months now. At the beginning, I was really anxious but that has calmed down now, although I still worry about my health but not as much as I used to. However, the past few weeks, I've been having these random aches and pain. My right cheek hurts sometimes (on and off), I get these weird aches in my upper jaw and pressure like feeling in my ears, temples and crown region of my head. Basically, it's just on and off facial pain and headaches. It's not too bad, just makes me uncomfortable at times. Can these be physical symptoms of stress? Are there any ways to manage this at home? Thanks a lot!",1
"I'm regularly getting compliments about my physique and it's making me feel better Tl Dr - skinny kid turned slightly less skinny gets compliments from random people (mostly men) Growing up I was always the weak scrawny kid, it was my one defining feature other than my glasses. I thought it would change once I joined the military after highschool. I definitely got stronger and maybe a little bigger but not by much. Military strength is all about endurance and that doesn't usually make you more muscular. I would go to the gym regularly because I wanted to stay in shape obviously but I didn't really know what I was doing. Again, slight improvements but not a lot. A few years ago I finally got smart about working out, and diet (a little). I love working out so much now, it's my biggest hobby. I've noticed starting last year that I would occasionally get a compliment from a friend or family member about how I look good, or like I take care of myself. This made me feel embarrassed because I don't know how to take compliments. But since then I've gotten more into it, and made noticable gains especially to my arms and legs. Cut to last night, starting a new job at a warehouse. One person who I never met said in a group conversation that he wants to get big like me. Another, who I never met, who's first words to me were ""man I gotta get back to the gym"". People in my unit have been complimenting me on my progress a lot recently too because they remember when I was much skinnier. I'm 5'8"", 160lbs, so I'm not a big guy by any stretch. But it just makes me feel so good to have all my hard work recognized. I have no plans on stopping since I actually feel like I have a long way to go. I didn't know who to share this with without sounding like I'm bragging, but I guess I kind of am.",0
"Why do my friends ask if I'm ""okay""? Lately, I've been approached by a couple of close friends who have asked me if ""everything is okay"". Truth be told, I'm not unhappy - but I'm content with my life. Sure there are somethings I'd like to change. I'm not ""unhappy"". However, I really don't I'm the kind of person that can be ""happy"". I have 3 children (grown), a so-so marriage, no job (on unemployment), and taking meds for depression (Zoloft). So, I'm not depressed - I'm okay - but I would say I'm happy. I have accepted things as they are. I'm kind of in a malaise. And while it might be the zoloft preventing me from being happy - I would never want to remove the support it gives me from being depressed (been there - done that - never want to experience that again). If I had to make a list of things that would make me ""happy"", and the chance of it happening, I would imagine it to be Find a job that gives me personal fulfillment (40%) Fix my marriage (30%) Make sure my 20-something children are safe/sound/employed. (0%) As someone struggling with depression, Is it possible to be happy in today's world?",1
"Stressed do the point of getting sick Hi everyone, I’m new but wasn’t sure where else to turn or what to do. I recently got a new job after going out of my comfort zone and leaving my previous employer of 6 years. Since then, I have been trying to get myself out of debt and caught up on bills I’m behind on, as well as trying to just get back on my feet. It’s been a struggle, as I hate change, but I’m proud of myself. My new job is salary, and since I’m newer, HR is slowly getting my login credentials for some things, including the pay portal. And the pay weeks aren’t the typical Sunday-Saturday, so I’m not too sure how it all works. Imagine my surprise when I got into work and saw an email from HR. Evidently after a payroll audit, they determined I’ve been paid $1100 too much, so it’ll be deducted from my next paycheck. I am freaking out. I have bills budgeted and in auto pay. My dog has an expensive procedure scheduled for next Friday. And that $1100 is almost my entire check. I emailed HR and asked if it could be divided among multiple pays, and I am praying they agree to that. Otherwise, what else do I do?",1
"I miss the old me I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food I gave him today because he’s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I’m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different. EDIT I never expected this post to blow up so much and I’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. Thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special",1
"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday. I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without. I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start. Edit I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. Also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing )",0

I was about to finally end it, when my dog came in and looked at me and I just stopped what I was doing and broke down in tears. I explained this to my boyfriend, and he said what I was about to do was weak and he has no sympathy for people like me. I’m not sure how to respond to that. I don’t know if I’m feeling embarrassed or regret that I didn’t just actually do it. I don’t think the judgement changed any of my desire to do that.

"I'm so stressed out that I'm tired even after sleeping until 7pm I liked going to this forum for depressed people. The only problem was one of the mods there, who happens to be the husband of the owner of the forum, has always been really rude to me. And every time I reported his mean comments, he would get super ticked off at me. I posted a ""Letters to Admin"" thread, saying I still feel bad that back in August that guy PM'd me telling me to stop complaining about him and asking me ""Why can't you just be normal?"" and that guy (or his wife, who is nice but biased towards her husband it seems) IP banned me. I was chatting with members there. One of them was a nice member that helped explain a very bad situation I'm in, quite clearly. But when I was IP banned and used a form to ask if I was really banned, I got a message back and it said some rude things such as ""Everyone is tired of you messaging them."" Now I feel really bad. I didn't know I was bothering people that much there.. To make matters all the worst, I was freaking locked out of my Twitter account. I followed like just 3 accounts in a row (seriously) and was locked out for unusual activity. Usually when this happens, I get texted a verification code and enter that and it lets me back in. However, this time it said I will get a phone call with a verification code. I tried 3 times, but I don't get a phone call. I e-mailed Twitter explaining that and requesting to get a text verification code again instead of a phone call, but I just got this terrible automated response [ Now that I can't get into my Twitter account, and it doesn't allow me to make a new account because too many accounts are linked to my phone number, I don't know how to do the only thing I really feel like doing Sharing my gaming videos and drawings etc. ...It really, really stresses me out.

I feel like I’m addicted to depression. Whenever I feel sad I don’t try to cheer up I try to make myself sadder because I like it more.

"I can't seem to find anything worth the effort. Hello, I just need a place to vent. I don't know if it makes sense or not. I feel that I have been living under this fog for the last 2 or 3 years. Everything lost its meaning. Nothing seems meaningful anymore. I just cannot find the energy to even try to try new stuff. I am constantly bored but at the same time not doing anything to have fun. Nothing is fun anymore. I stopped trying. Now I just... exist. That's it. I only exist but not in any meaningful way. The worst part is the following. I was supposed to be ""succesful"", my family had huge hopes for me and they tried to give me everything I need. I have everything I need. I don't have any reason to be like this, unhappy and bored all the time, but I am. This caused me to slowly hate myself and now I literally hate myself. I just hate the person that I see every night in the mirror. I just hate him with all my gut. I pushed people out of my life. I think I did it deliberately because I did not want anyone to see me like this. I did not let them know that I became a failure not even trying to do anything about it. Eventually, everybody moved on. I am not blaming them. It's not like they are supposed to waste their time trying to help a hopeless case like me. It makes sense that they moved on. Now everybody is trying to improve themselves and I just have this hate towards everyone. Nobody did anything wrong and I just hate them for having the courage to try being happy. I just hate them for not hating themselves three seconds after they wake up. I just hate them for getting out of bed and start their day trying to get better and improve themselves. This caused me to push everyone even further. I cannot contact people because I don't want to answer the question ""so what are you doing these days?"" because I don't have an answer to give. I am not doing anything. I never thought that I was going to become this disgusting human being that literally does not do anything, does not try to get anything done and hates other people for doing stuff. I just hate myself and I don't think that there is any hope left. I am just stuck inside my brain. I just don't think that there is anything left for me on this planet. I am done.

"living a normal healthy positive life sounds exhausting All the stuff I'm doing right now, is in theory to eventually get to this idealized normal healthy life.

But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be.

I hate that I... ..sleep in so late. ...stay up so late. ...never leave the house. ...never exercise. ...never go hiking anymore. ...never go to meetups. ...am so lazy. ...am so fat. ...have no self control. ...eat so much. ...am alone. ,1
"I want to stop relying on medicine I worry what antidepressants will do to my body in the long run. Whenever i get blood work done, the results always come back abnormal (my liver enzymes are always elevated) and my regular doctor thinks it is because of the meds i take. I also have problems sleeping most of the time. I rarely get restful sleep. Is it possible for me to find a psychiatrist that would make a plan to get me better and get off of the meds? I am afraid to stop taking them immediately because i have read that it can mess your body up. I feel like every psychiatrist i go to doesn't really do anything to help get me better. I understand i will never be perfect but i feel there has to be a way for me to live my life without shoving pills down my throat the rest of my life",1
"My crush confessed her feelings for me and a bit after being too nervous to text her back, I confessed my feelings too. I was talking to my crush and I started doing random roses are red, violets are blue poems and I did this one, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, don't sleep at night, cuz im thinking of you, alone with my thoughts, trapped in this bed, I'd give the world, just to see you again"" and she said that it's relatable and me being me, asked ""Who"" and well we played a guessing game I guess and then it ended up being only me left and well... she said she liked me nervously. I wasn't sure if she trolling me but I confessed my feelings too and well... I don't know whats going to happen but she went to bed a bit after that and we said goodnight to eachother.",0
I was doing so good As the title states I was just doing so good and then she came along made me feel like I was on top of the world and then just left like I was less than trash I just wish I never met her now I’m back to square one feeling like I’m worthless exactly where she wants me to be. I just feel like I should vanish and never come back because no one would miss me,1
My abusive parents think me being depressed and my self harm tendencies are gonna land them in jail I'm useless. I'm 19 years old. I live with my abusive mother and my pedophile grandfather. My mother hates me because I no longer put up with her abusive behavior. She thinks she is allowed to hurt me however she can because she is my mom and that I shouldn't feel hurt back. My dad left me as a kid with my pedophile grandfather and abusive mother. I started crying yesterday because my friend betrayed me and threw me out like I was nothing. My dad was just annoyed the entire car ride and claimed that I was 'crazy' and 'weak'. Then he brought up how I self harmed and that I'm going to destroy my mom and him with my suicidal behavior. That they're gonna go to prison because of me. My mother is narcissiistic and makes everything about her. She was upset at me crying because I never once cried for her or shared my pain with her but instead with my friend online. I don't know what to do.,1
"UNIVERSITIES REALLY DON'T CARE i am sure covid has been extra stressful for everyone, countless people have lost their jobs, their health has deteriorated and I'm sure students can relate that online classes have been extremely stressful. I do also understand where the professors stand, they had to shift their whole life to sitting in front of a computer to teach to a bunch of unenthusiastic students who won't even turn their cameras on, but, at the same time, we too are overpaying for an educational experience that isn't an experience at all. Sitting at our computers all day, rushing to finish deadlines and studying for tests and just staying focused is hard, while managing work that's just the cherry on top. I do have some professors who have been very understanding and have helped a lot, curving grades, providing extra credit, then we have my stats professor. He bases our grades so heavily on the tests (2 tests and 1 final), I have no idea what grade i have but I know i'm failing along with the rest of my class. I've never done this badly in school ever! I have never failed a class to say the least. Not understanding to our circumstances, as an international student, having to be awake at 3am to focus of math is a feat. I've emailed him expressing my concerns, no reply. And its not just me, the entire class is failing. I have enrolled in the same class with a different professor for next semester in case I do not make it, which I won't unless he curves it a whole 10%. The amount of stress that is just waiting to blow up is insane and I cannot do anything to help! My thoughts keep circulating back and fixating on that one thing. How do you guys manage stress and anxiety?!!! Ive tried almost everything",1
"My girlfriend (ex now I guess) died in a car crash last week and we had dated since 10th grade and am 22 years old now. Am I terrible person for not even believing it’s real? Am I worse to fear going to her celebration of life because of how my emotions may come out? I’ve never lost anyone who I’ve loved this much and I almost feel like dying with her. We always talked about how we were soul mates and would die together. The emptiness I feel is voidful and I’m not sure how to exist right now. (Edit) First some of you shared your past loses with me and it helped to feel surrounded by people who are still living strong despite such awful circumstances which made me feel awesome for lack of a better vocabulary. And I love every one of you! Second, Wow. I did not expect this overwhelming amount of support here and I feel like the whole world (or at least this small subreddit) is able to understand, empathize with me. It makes the this void of darkness I was looking into last night suddenly have a blossoming of light at the bottom. More importantly, helped me to understand that she is not gone unless I believe she is, and she can still live on with me through my passions and I can continue hers in one way or another. She always supported my dreams of becoming Goku lol cheesy I know but now I will aspire even higher to looking and acting like Goku. And I supported her dreams of traveling and we went so many places but never to Rome because we could never afford it. I will go there and see the wonders of Rome for us! Thank you all for helping me realize that it’s okay to feel, whatever that feeling may be, as long as it is benevolent.",1
"Done I’ve had thoughts before but not this bad, my friends cut me off cause I haven’t been going to school they called me a bum and all this other stuff which I already know I am, but it still hurt, after all the stuff I’ve done for these niggas when they were at there lowest points, I always had there backs but now there so quick to cut me off and say all this shit to me, and are mad because I made 20000 dollars over vacation and think I’m flexing when In reality I’m happy to have money, anyways they were like family to me as I’m not close to my real family at all but now I have nobody and I’m ready to end it all, I’m done with all the bullshit and nobody even cares",1

Like I'll be out trying to enjoy myself and I'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but I still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling.

"hurt Im not a very vocal person. I tend to express myself better through writing. This makes it so hard for me to get a job in somewhere i always wanted to work as. I end up settling for places that where the interviewer has made the decision based on my resume itself instead of my vocal skills. Today, I had an interview for a position in a well-paying government job that i have always wanted. I can see myself working with them but just i had to go fuck up the interview cause i hate talking to people. I feel like fucking ripping my hair out because I am not a naturally charming person that can waft my way through things. im not conventionally attractive or charming or any of those things so it makes it all the more difficult to actually get the things that I want. I feel like a damn failure at 25,unemployed and struggling to find a fucking job when all my peers are excelling in their careers and I am just here, being a slob.",1
"My surgery went so well. I went from debilitating chronic pain to completely pain-free in days. I feel so lucky. I just want to share because I'm so happy. I feel like I have a new lease on life. I wasn't able to walk and spent so much time in bed, now I'm appreciating all the beauty life has to offer so much more. I'll never take for granted being pain-free again. I was honestly fighting for my life I was so depressed and frantic because of how much pain I was feeling. And now I feel so good, my body feels so beautiful and healthy. I'm excited about my future again.",0

Depression steals your youth away I remember when I was 15 and my depression started that was 1995 I hated school with a passion that was the first year I ever was on a antidepressant aka Prozac which didn't help at all. By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can. It may seem impossible but don't be a loser like me and quit right away keep on pushing while you can before it's to late.,1
"Worst part about depression is that I feel like I have no personality anymore. There are other worse stuff, but this is what comes to mind. Honestly feels like I’m bland af now and boring to other people. One of the reasons why I don’t even want to try anymore, because I don’t want to bore them.",1
"I feel like my life is a TV series that should've been cancelled 4 seasons ago Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even my greatest accomplishments make me feel anything, kind of like a show that's run its course but the showrunners keep finding ""cool"" and ""wacky"" scenarios to put the main characters in, but nothing hits like it used to. I just want whatever the fuck this is to end.",1

"What I've been going through lately So currently, I'm in high school. And in my Psychology class, we were assigned a project about mental disorders to work on over spring break. And today is the last day of spring break, and the project is due tomorrow. And I havent started the project due to no wifi at home. I havent had wifi in 3 weeks. Life wiithout wifi sucks, but you get used to it. You find other things to do, what I did was drew pictures and knitted. Yes knitted, my grandma taught me awhile ago. It is actually fun, until you loose the loops, meaning the yarn fell off your knitting needle and you have to guess where the loops were.... The thing I'm making is all screwed up due to that happeninh... but yeah I can knit. Back to the no wifi thing, somehow my tablet still shows I have wifi...and my apps work. And Youtube on my tablet will not work without wifi, I even have data but it still won't work, so if it's working I know I'm good. So I hope this actually does get posted.....if not oh well..... As I stated earlier, I'm in high school. Which means I live with my parents. And our landlord wants us out, so he can either rent to someone else, or rent the house to his daughters. And to be honest the house isn't in good condition. When we moved in, the walls weren't repainted, the plumbing wasn't fixed etc. And the heater is broken, when it rains the ceiling leaks...and so on....I actually posted what the landlord has been doing and stuff on this sub reddit awhile ago. So you can check it out if you want. Anyways last week on Thursday, we recieved a notice to move out by Sunday, which is today. We have gotten almost everything out....but still have the essentials left, T.V., couch, my parents bed and bed frame, fridge, mine and my brothers baby stuff that my mom doesn't want to lose, and my dad's tools.... We got approved for an apartment, but can't move stuff in until tomorrow at 11 00. But we have to be out by midnight tonight.... So instead of a hotel, we are staying here for the night hoping no ones comes by to escort us out. We are staying because if we went to a hotel and came back for the rest of our stuff, we would lose the stuff..... Ontop of this, my dad started drinking again....and yesterday he went outback to have a smoke, and he somehow caught his hair on fire....still not sure how it happened.... But I'll never forget his scream.....it's going to haunt me forever.... But luckily he is okay. And thank god he is. He did, however, get slightly burned on his forehead. But other than that he's alive, breathing and not in the hospital. Before that happened, I actually was thinking of cutting myself because of everything that has been going on. But I was going to do deep cuts to where I would need to go to the hospital... And I was going to do it... But I never went through with it. Especially after hearing my dad scream, I couldn't bring myself to do it.... Due to all this moving, my dog has been acting weird. She's been shaking, whining, trying to wedge herself under chairs, trying to hide under the table, etc. Everytime I look at her, she has this sad look in her eyes, and I feel bad for her. I think why she is like this is because she thinks we are going to take her back to the pound or abandon her. But we are not the kind of people to do that, she's been a part of this family for about 7 years I think....I'm not sure.. So yeah that's my life at the moment... ",1
"I am very afraid I’ve been unhappy for most of my life with the exception of maybe the first few years. I’ve been bullied most of my life mainly during school and not having many friends and my mental state wasn’t in much of a good place either, I mainly often hid it but sometimes I had some stuff happen in school that was quite embarrassing, and due to me being unhappy I’m fucked for the future with shite school results and me never really being capable to do much better I don’t know if I can go really much further like this. I’d rather just have what happened to one of my favourite tv show/book character and then I’d be fine.",1
"I hate how people boast about how much they support mental illness then once they meet a mentally ill person they want nothing to do with them It's just so fucking tiresome. You see it everywhere on social media. People will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like ""man up"", ""stop being so sensitive"", ""hey bro at least you're not a starving child in Africa"", ""bro it's just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively"", and so on. Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. I just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?",1
NEED HELP FOR A STRESSED OUT UNI STUDENT hey guys I'm new here so sorry if I'm ranting crying_face . This is my 2 semester of uni and honestly I'm dying. I was suppose to leave my country for uni since its abroad but it's been online for now. Just a background I've dealt with anxiety and depression for some years now and even used to take medication for it. I'm off of it now. Uni sucked for me even in semster 1 but somehow I got through. This time everything just feels so much harder and like I'm definitely failing most of my courses. I've never has a good relationship with academics. A lot of my problems stem from that. And honestly at this point I'm searching Google 'how to study' because I have no idea. I'm not too sure if I absolutely hate my degree. Its bachelor of economics. It's just even if I dont like that it's not like I have something else in mind that I would want to study. I already failed a course in sem 1 and taking it again in sem 2. And now I feel I'll fail like 4 of my courses for sure. Half of the stuff I dont get and I dont know how do I study especially when all I feel is so much street and anxiety and pressure. The more I think about it the more I get panic attacks. And just not doing uni is not an option for me. Like I've definitely thought of it but know its something I cant do. So now I'm here just asking for help. I dont know what to do. I cant seem to study and even if I do I cant seem to get things. Being online I feel such a discontent from professor and my peers alike. Like I genuinely have no uni friends. I cant fail because I dont have time to do those failed courses again. Most of my assignments up till now have either been bad grades or just not submitted. I dont know how I'm suppose to do the rest of the term. Honestly feel like just not doing life.,1
"Is life only about distracting myself until I die? So it's been like that for 5 years, and I've been telling myself over, and over again that it would get better with time, but I dont think anymore that it will, nor do I know if I'd actually want it to be better. The whole covid thing made it way harder to distract myself as much as I did before, which made me realise how my life really looked like. Is there really a point in living a life, in which I only look to the things that happened in the past, and ignore the present day as well as the future? Is this really what my life have become?",1

"Nobody wants to deal with negative people You really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers, friends, and family. If you’re not always a ray of sunshine, you become the negative, depressed person who is no fun to be around. At the end of the day, no one really gives a shit about what you’re dealing with. If you’re not being positive and smiling, no matter the reason, they have a problem with you. I wish there wasn’t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing. It is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor.",1
I am so fucking sick I am a 15 year old in a shit Arab country i have no friends i don't know how or where to make friends and i am sick of opening every fucking social media and seeing people the same age enjoying life and i don't have anyone to talk to i hate everything about myself It's to the point where i have no confidence i can't talk to people normally i either stutter or lower my voice i am addicted to pornogrphy and i have no hobbies or passions i can't do things because i have no energy or power and i wake up everyday like 1 pm i can't handle this anymore,1

To them I am a liability, a burden. I am average looking with no Personality or skills and suffer from social anxiety. I don't know how to talk to people and as such I have never able to connect with anyone. I believe I am handicapped like this I am broke , in a dead end job, don't have any hobbies , have made zero friends in the past decade. Haven't experienced a woman's touch and I believe I am unlikely ever to. It's not the fact that I haven't yet made any friends or never had a girlfriend but the fact that whatever little connection I manage to make, it fizzles out quickly becs like I said, I simply don't know how to connect with anyone. As such I believe I will most likely die all alone , with never having experienced affection ever in my worthless life",1
"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"" Everything I do in my life always brings me back to this song lyric. It describes depression better than anything else. You can think you're okay, but you're never okay. Everything is always the same no matter what you do.",1
Anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up. In laying here about to sleep and every night I have the mantra in my head of that I hope I never wake up. I don't want to kill myself but I'd rather just never wake up again. That way no one will be mad at me for dying by my own hand. That way I can't disappoint anyone anymore. Anyone else?,1
"Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same. I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. I truly appreciate it.",1
"Hi!! I love dragons and tiny things and moments make me happy! I really love dragons and other fantasy creatures, but dragons the most. I've started asking people to draw me a dragon if they ever have a little time on their hand to do so. I absolutely love all of the drawings! Most of the people I ask are hesitant because they claim they can't draw, but it's not true! I assure them that they can draw a dragon, or a fantasy creature of their choice, in any way they want and I will not judge, I'll always be happy they tried. I've gotten so many dragons (about 10 right now) and I love how unique and different they are from each other. Each reminds me of the person that drew it and I just cannot describe how happy I am that some people dedicated minutes or even hours of their days to make me a drawing. I've mostly asked friends but also family and a few internet friends too and they all did amazing! Some do a simple design, some have a more complicated one, there are cute dragons, fierce dragons, silly dragons, a couple new creatures, some with colors, some without. My mom did one and my brother too, and it took some convincing to make them do it but they did and I could see that they smiled too when I lit up.",0
"Friend and I shared our first deeply sexual experiences and I am incredibly honored by how safe and comfortable she felt. Me and a really close friend just shared our first deeply sexual experiences after a whole day of cuddling and deep conversation. We talked about everything-and felt like we didn’t have to hide anything from eachother. One thing led to another and we felt comfortable to do just about everything but get to home base. God she was beautiful. I’d never felt more accepted and understood. We frequently checked on eachother to make sure we were still comfortable, and asked for consent for everything. She’s been pressured to do things in the past, and even though we’re just friends, she told me this was the safest and most comfortable she ever felt, and holy fuck that is an amazing thing to hear. I really care about her and I’m so incredibly grateful to have a friend like her.",0
"Life is slipping away from me, please read me I am 19 years old. I am a woman. I am young, I know. I still have a lot of life left, I know. A lot of good things can still happen, I know. In fact, I'm waiting for it, I have been waiting for the future since I can remember because I have had a terrible childhood and adolescence. My life, until now, has been full of abuse from my family, I had a partner who took full advantage of me and traumatized me when I was still malleable, I have had friends who have pushed me aside (not all of them and I have good friends now), and now I am ruining everything for myself as I'm heavily depressed and can barely function. If I'm not sad, I'm angry, and if I'm not angry, I'm numb. Days go by and I don't even notice. I have not had meaningful conversations with anyone in months. I don't remember being hugged so far this year. I have barely done anything in the last months because of how sad and tired I am all the time. I wish I had someone to share, but even if I meet someone I will barely text them back or make plans because texting is tiring to me right now and making plans means negotiating with my weird parents which I have always hated. I have pushed everyone and everything away, even myself. I can't even read nor watch movies. I don't notice the time passing by. I get out of bed and can't bear my own weight from how little life I feel. I don't pay attention in class. If someone asks me something, I answer something nonsensical because my mind is not here. I'm really very, very, very sad. I was this sad before when my ex-partner took advantage of me, but at that point I had friends to lean on. I still have them, but if I look for them now, what am I even going to tell them? *“Help me, I feel like life is slipping away from me”*, and then what? I will just worry them, and they won't be able to help me because we all are so young. Have you felt this way? What should I do? I would like to write, I like to write, but my days seem to go-by in the blink of an eye. What should I do to focus? To feel more alive? With more energy? What has helped you? Not everything is lost for me, I think. I'm very smart, and my mind is very creative, it is my happy place at times, I just can't find the time to express what is going on there bc I'm tired and days feel fast. I honestly don't know what else can helpme right now apart from expressing myself. The pandemic ended my plans to leave home, which was my old only hope to finally feel free of the abuse I have endured all these years and has rotten me to the core. It is still my only hope, but now it is more distant, which sucks haha, to say the least. Plus, I don't really want to leave my little sister and dogs with them, to be honest. I can wait a few more years for them, but dying every day a little bit more on the inside haha. I place emphasis on my home because my parents really absorb a lot of energy from me. I'm scared of ruining my life because of this depression. I'm afraid of becoming a *“she had a lot of potential”* because I do have it. And a lot of dreams too. I just need more energy. That is all I'm asking for. I have even asked the starts. I hope everyone who is reading this is having a good day )",1

Does anyone know what's happened to me? Recently I've had an intense buildup of stress. I've felt awful. But a few minutes ago it all stopped. None of the problems causing the stress have been resolved. I just suddenly feel empty and emotionless.

Everything went back to normal soon after though which is close enough to ok. Should I be concerned? Why don't I feel anything after practically drowning in stress for the past few weeks?,1

I don't want to die, I want to just be able to have what I need to live and never have to work hard in my life. And that is too much to ask for, so then I don't want to keep suffering in life, and dying seems easy. When I hung out with a friend it was akward and I just kept asking them questions about how they were doing, they said they had to go after 30 minutes. No one reaches out to me anymore. When I hang out I can't help but be akward. Who can blame people who want to numb reality just enough to live another day.",1
"My neighbour is stressing me out She has two kids, and her friends always come over with small children and baby's. We love in an apartment, she's the door right across from me. When we first moved in two years ago we introduced ourselves to her and her partner at the time we were very friendly. (She's in her late 30s) (me and my boyfriend are in our mid 20's) I've never seen her partner after that. Though out the years we have tried knocking on her door asking her to move her car for snow removal, and to maybe split with us to get the whole driveway plowed but she never answers her door even if we know she's in there. So we noticed that our garbage bin was full of loose garbage for a while, not ours, we cleaned it out put it in bags and took it to the curb....the next week it was full again (dog poop, baby dipers) (the neighbour just got a dog last summer) we empty it again wanting to use our garbage bin......the next week it's full again so we leave it. (It's been full for 3 months now and no one has touched it) so a week later we go to put our compost into our compost bin, and it's full of garbage, the same kinda loose stuff in the bin. We have no idea what to do with our compost now last week we took it and put it in our downstairs neighbors compost bin at the curb...... ( Now I don't know if it's actually her garbage, bug I've always seen her garbage in the ally and never at the curb including when she had bags) to me I know it's her but I don't know what to do about it. If I try to get ahold of her she ignores the door, and if I leave a note on her door she will probably just chuck it and be made at us cause she's untitled. (She smokes in her apartment and blasts music and always seems to be partying) I have no idea what I should do.... Me on the other hand....I haven't been able to leave my house with out an axiety meltdown. And I don't know how to put a lock on my greenbin.",1
"How do I stop stressing out about things out of my control? I’m a step mom, and I have to constantly go from worrying about my step kids being abused physically, emotionally, and via neglect by their bio mom, to then having to worry about myself and my boyfriend dealing with their emotional breakdowns and extremely hurtful comments that just tear you apart.... I have to watch my boyfriend being taken advantage of and disrespected by his family that we can’t get out of our lives because we are financially dependent on them due to COVID and my partner being too hurt to work right now.... there’s literally nothing I can do about any of these things except wait and survive. What do I do to stop stressing myself out to the point of throwing up?",1
Is it just me or do the cons outweigh the pros in life? It may just be the depression talking but I seriously think that there is more bad than good in this life we live.,1
"Feeling really useless I've always been a lurker or casual commenter here, so here's my first post. This lockdown has really exacerbated my depression. (tho the culprit really is just being in a human society lol) I feel isolated and alone. I've opened up to a few people but I always end up sounding like a broken record and people say the same shallow things to console me. So I just stopped talking to the people around me about feeling depressed. My depression has led me to quitting my job; trust me, I wasn't far from getting let go. So I quit before it got real bad. I worked in a creative industry and the burnout feels permanent. And I struggle to make money. Freelance pays so little, and I'm living off my life savings, which is not much. Plus my art isn't even doing well. My works are ignored, or even if I get a commission or freelance project, I get paid less than minimum wage. I've learnt to say no and I do negotiate my rates but the desperation has caused me to just do what I can to stay afloat. I'm almost 30, so being a crybaby about it just paints myself as immature to those around me. Never gonna be able to afford a house, car, kids. I don't have the capacity to handle most jobs. But I did try my best before this. Most days I have sleep and tears for dinner. I always forget to shower and brush my teeth. My partner is stuck overseas indefinitely, so I've lost my strongest support system. The pain and loss I feel on a daily basis is unbearable. Some days I wish I had the guts to just end my life, but instead I just wallow in my own sadness and filth. I don't even know what would make me happy, or at least dull the pain a little. Maybe some company and a bit of help here and there would make it a bit better, but I know I'd still feel dead inside. And therapy? I can't afford it. Plus I know how therapists console people. I'm sure some of you relate to that thing you do where you have a rebuttal for every advice given... I've been the therapist friend, only just speaking from experience. There's no point to this post, just letting it out of my chest.",1

"I miss the person I used to be I'll admit that even years ago I wasn't very happy and had problems, but I still miss the way I was back then. I still had things that made me happy, hobbies I enjoyed. And I actually had the motivation to do them! I could spend hours of my day doing something and completely forgetting the real world for a while. Now I can't find the motivation to do anything. But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely. I don't have any hope anymore, I don't have any motivation, I don't have anything to look forward to. And I just really fucking miss that part of me",1
"I don't know what I'm going to do. I've been struggling for a while now with depression, and some of the people around me as well as events that have occurred really exasperated everything. People told lies about me and made me question my sanity, and stirring up a lot of drama, I've lost my job and am having a really hard time finding a new one, I'm in a mountain of debt, my girlfriend dumped me, and now hates me because of the lies said about me and I feel like I can't trust anyone around me anymore. Not friends or family. I've really been considering ending it all, I'm just done with everything, I can't enjoy anything anymore it feels like, I've got a bunch of tylenol I've been staring at for the past week. And I've never actually planned before, and that's what scares the shit out of me. I called the suicide hotline about two weeks ago which helped a little, but I'm still so fucking sad and I don't think I can take this anymore. I've also considered finding a job somewhere else entirely and just leaving everyone without notice and deleting everyone's number. But I think no matter what death is creeping on me. I don't know anymore, I've never been so unsure of life and the purpose of it. I just don't feel like I fit anywhere, and I feel like my death would be convenient for everyone around me. I don't think I have purpose anymore, I feel like I exist for no reason. I just don't know anymore. I feel so isolated",1
"What else do they want from me? (Vent) It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll. I've talked to my direct manager, I've talked to the managers above her, I've talked extensively to Human Resources. I've been making it clear that I'm reaching my breaking point since mid-September, but all I get back is the same hemming and hawing about ""we're trying, we're under-staffed, we're really trying, promise it'll get better soon."" I called off today - and I almost never do that - because I spent all night stress crying, and knowing it's only going to get 20x worse because of the holidays. The manager I talked to immediately chastised me for not trying to reach out to them before my stress got to this point, and tried to guilt me into coming in anyway. I've talked to everybody that I'm 'supposed' to like a good little employee, I've been so visibly stressed out and near-tears that other managers have been doing the reaching out *for* me, what else could they possibly want???

"I cant find peace and happiness, feel like a burden to everyone Hey My ex broke up with me 2 months ago, and i still canr get over her. She called me once,around 2 weeks ago and aaid that lets be friends and talk and if she catches feelings we can date again, i denied it, i cried after hanging up the call,because i knew she isn't good for me and my mental health. But i still miss her, i go to bed thinking about her and wake up thinking about her, i cant sleep properly and usually cry to sleep or cry if i see her pictures. I feel miserable and sad all the time although i try to keep a happy face in front of people. I'm just tired of this shit, i really really fucking misss her, i want to talk to her, but i just cant. I have never felt this lonely in my whole life, i dont find joy in music, games or any other shit which used to make me happy. Everyone keeps telling me to forget her and move on and i just can't. I keep coming back to think about her and tears naturally keep flowing. I hate myself to the core and feel like hurting myself or just do anything for some physical pain. Im just so mentally tired, i am not getting anything done. It's really fucking me up, i feel like it was better if i could just erase everything from my brain. For those wondering why she isn't good for my mental health, she lied and still lies a lot, kep me in dark, planned to meet her ex and when i caught her redhanded she still denies to this day that she went to meet him, double dated and all this just fucked me up real bad.

"My anti stress plan I've been dealing with a life-altering chronic illness for the last 2 years. Historically, I deal with stress with weight-lifting, cardio, and dance (I used to train 7 to 14 hours a week) Since I've become sick, I've lost all of my friends, can no longer dance, and can't weight lift. I know that stress exacerbates my illness, but the illness also causes most of my stress and robs me of my life-long tools for dealing with stress. I'm directly dealing with stress, but here's my overall plan * Make better use of a calendar to plan responsibilities. That way, I can forget about the problem until the reminder shows up. * Put things in perspective and accept the bad things in life/work instead of worry about them * Try to laugh and smile * Take a cold shower when I get home from work.

"Deadline Have any of you ever given yourself a dead line for the end of your life? Trying to completely phase yourself out of having to feel anything. For example. My Wife and I are on a 6 month trial for a our marriage. Going to see a therapist to try and save what we have. I’ve managed to convince myself that if we don’t work. In 6 months by the time we re assess the situation it won’t be my issue anymore. Because I’ll be dead anyway. I’ve put myself in this position before. My wife was the one who saved me. I told her it was going to be my last Christmas with her and the kids. I wanted one more Christmas with them before I went. I spent that Christmas and the 4 weeks prior to that clinging to life in a hospital bed infected with COVID. All I felt she picked me up on my discharge day was so much anger, I felt so cheated. I was not supposed to live. I did everything I could possibly do while there short of taking my own life. I wouldn’t eat. Wouldn’t drink. Refused meds and oxygen. And I still fucking lived. I’m sure I’ll get told how selfish I am on account of the souls that fought Covid and lost. If I could trade places with any of them I would… fast forward to now and I’m so fucking ready to just burn. I used to think I was too much of a pussy to kill myself. Every day I grow a little closer to that point. I’m not there yet. But brother I’m on that road. Counting my days",1

"Leaving I don’t know how to stop the flow of hatred in my heart, despite life not being “bad” for me at the moment. I get odd/deep senses of dissatisfaction within myself and begin to slowly pull back from literally anything and anybody that’s currently in my life. It always makes sense to me that it’ll be easier to leave if less people care and are impacted by my decision. I know people love and care about me and emphasize they want me here and it weighs on me continuously, but I can’t help but think everyone’s lives will be easier and much happier if I’m not around. As of recent I’ve been subconsciously pushing away my closest relationships, not intentionally, but it feels my emotions have been making the decisions for me. I’m much closer to leaving than I normally am I’m scared and I don’t know what to do I’m stuck between stopping myself from being unhappy and being completely selfless",1
"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life. Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way. The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards. I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human. And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly. I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore. Edit all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you. Edit 2 wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",1

"Wish I Knew It Is Okay to Speak Up As many of you may be aware, there has been an ongoing problem of student suicides on university and college campuses. Many universities have chosen to stay silent of this issue and have not taken enough measures to try to improve the situation and to offer more accessible resources to their students. In light of this problem, I would like to share the following video to everyone as a reminder, again, that it is okay to speak up, it is okay to talk about mental health issues and it is okay to share your thoughts, feelings and challenges. What you think and how you feel - your emotions and thoughts - are valid and important. Even for just a bit, Wish I Knew would like play a role to help students through providing additional resources and a platform that can reach many and that can be comfortable for many to access. Video Link [ If you are attending a university in Fall 2019 and are interested in content like this, please follow our pages on Facebook by searching ""Accepted - ""university name"", Class of 2023"".

My step-parents are great and my step-brother is one of my best friends. On paper, i’m living the dream. Yet i just can’t find any sort of peace with myself, i get overwhelmed/stressed with too much social interaction and i’m always critiquing myself. My mum’s a counsellor and we just don’t get along (mindset-wise) and she claims i have mild Asperger’s syndrome, as a number of my friends/teachers have previously said. This doesn’t bother me because the result is irrespective of anything in my life, but recently i am finding myself thinking about some deep, dark shit (although a lot of which i know i would never do). I have been in this place before, multiple times, but this definitely feels different. I’ve had some close calls before, very serious car crash when i was 17 and a trip to hospital of an LSD trip gone majorly wrong. I would love to say i care but it seems as if i’ve just given up on myself recently, i want to be the best person i can but i have NEVER successfully managed a friendship which hasn’t gone wrong (probably because of me) and i’ve never been emotionally involved because i am so fucking insecure of everything to do with emotions. i have never EVER spoken about myself like to this anyone before, let alone to the public, i just don’t understand it. I appreciate this has been a very tedious message to read but i humbly assure you it was more painful to write, the only reason i did was because i’m currently avoiding my parents at all costs because i physically can’t have a conversation with anyone right now, i’m exhausted.

"I know the solution to not being depressed any longer but I cannot do it. First off, I want to mention that I am a MtF transgender, I have a father who is a terrible person, and I have extreme anger issues and anxiety. I am no longer suicidal, but I live in constant agony. I am stuck inside a body with the wrong parts and hormones. I believe that my body is a woman's body and that I have the mind of a woman. Aside from the hormones and privates, nothing about me is masculine in any way. My father is just... read the post I made about him. Its too much to even put into one sentence. Both of these things make me constantly upset. The dysphoria and the abuse from my dad. I am a few months shy of 15 years old, meaning that I am not in control of my body. All of these things make me so angry. I already have anger issues, but lately they've been even worse. Its so hard to control myself since nothing I've tried calms me, and when I get angry, I feel like I have no control over my body and I begin to shake and hit things. Also, I am pretty sure that the testosterone has something to do with my anger. I need two things that will help. Getting rid of my dad, and fully transitioning. Now about my dad... Hes done nothing good. One example I didn't make in that post is that when I was depressed and suicidal pre transition, I told him that my entire life has been a joke. He yelled at me saying that ""your life hasn't even started yet."" Post transition and now whenever I mention anything about how I dont wanna think about myself pretransition, he gets mad and talks about how many important things happened during that time. And then if I mention the abuse from him that I associate with pretransition me, he gets mad saying that he went through worse or that ""thats in the past"" which is what I'm trying to get at. I never ever felt like myself, and now that I do, I want nothing to do with the terrible things I went through when I didn't even know who I was. I dont know what I really expect from posting this here, but I just really need to get this out. I need him out of my life. I need to fully transition. This is what I NEED to do, but I dont know how.

"i feel life is just one big cycle of nonsense im 16 right now, stopped going to school a year ago so started working 2 months ago. when i was 13 i realized that after graduating college its just eat, work, sleep, occasionally going out with friends/family cycle. dont know why i thought of it at the time but ever since it crossed my mind i just lost will to live. im not trying to say my parents is the cause but due to family problem every 2 or 3 years we move country to country (my mother is from philippines and father is japan) because of it i never really learned to make friends so i tend to be alone so i just focused on studying and thinking for my future until one day “it” crossed my mind, from that day i gradually lost focus on studying and ended up not going to school regularly until i stopped waking for school, at the time i was thinking how should i die, i lived in a 5 story apartment so at 11pm i went to the top preparing to jump but was scared of surviving it so i was thinking of how should i jump until my aunt showed up since we talked about suicide few weeks earlier and its really late for my reason of “i want brethe fresh air” (father and mother was working at japan at the time so my mother’s sister was taking care of me, of course my parents knew we talked about suicide but they just thought i making a reason so i could skip school, to be fair i was really lazy and obviously hated studying after thinking about it) after that i had really long talk with my parents at first they are expectedly angry but i can see that they really care for me, so i promised that i wont do it again. this happened at the start of 2020, we moved to japan this may but now i dont think i can keep that promise now, since i dont go to school and im not planning to. so i said i will work now, at first they were against it since i didnt do much for 2years and my body is kind of weak (also corona) but it was better than me not doing anything and ovethinking again. to be honest i dont know why im so scared of that idea, it maybe my made up reason for my laziness so i hope i didnt waste 2 years for my laziness now i just feel envy everytime i see a senior high because they were my classmate or same school 3 years ago and they have better future than me at the end i dont hate my parents, just really bad events(?), family of mother side was really messy, i didnt have confidence to talk at young age, i was comfortable speaking with others but didnt know how to initiate, bit of bullying in japan since im half on bright side i have income of 1100~1300$ per month at 16 so not everything is bad but still im scared i get bored and commit suicide wasted 1 hour of writing since laggy phone i have work tomorrow and its 10 30pm thanks for reading my vent",1
"How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up? I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that... so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for? Edit wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again.",1
I want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone? So I’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I’ll stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I’ll think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I’m doing is complaining. I’m just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this? And if you have do you have any advice for me?,1
"Best part of the day is sleeping when night comes, you just lay there in bed thinking of all your stressful problems then suddenly everything goes dark, your conciseness goes into rest, you are no longer aware of what's life or death, your brain is numb, and you seize to exist even for a moment, before start dreaming, you feel so happy like that time when you wer.... you wake up at 7 am ready to repeat your boring routine thats been bothering you for quite a while now but you have no choice but to keep going.",1

Is mental illness just in your head? So I’m 20(f) and have a few mental issues. Not to go into detail but I was diagnosed with bipolar and ptsd. My boyfriend is very supportive and helps me out a lot but tells me mental illness is just all in your head and if I really wanted to I could beat it without medication and stuff. I’m not on medication or anything but I’m very depressed and have a hard time just getting through life. So is all this just in my head? I try to be positive but I always go back to the same way. I’m really trying and I tell him that but he believes because he isn’t sad anymore that anybody can just cure themselves of mental illness. I’d just like to know everyone’s opinions or if there’s like actual facts proving that sometimes it can’t be controlled no matter how hard I try. Thanks ),1
"is it the depression or is it just me Obligatory I’m on the phone excuse any typos etc. thanks if you’re reading. I’m in my mid twenties. Have been getting help since December of last year. Been hospitalized at one point. Going to therapy regularly and on a cocktail of meds. I’m so grateful for everyone that is helping me through this. It’s so hard. I question whether it’s the depression or if it’s just me that’s a shitty human being. I’ve noticed some improvement but I still experience the same crappy behaviours, I’m just able to function better in regards to school/clinicals, friends, family etc. I’m still so good at pretending to be okay. One thing that hasn’t changed is the fact that I hate myself. I feel like I’m not doing enough to help myself and I know that I’m the one responsible for it. It’s just so exhausting. I don’t know if I’m just sabotaging myself or what exactly is wrong with me that I haven’t progressed more. And honestly i don’t know if I’ll ever be good enough.",1

"Being depressed and having depression are different. I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye Edit I’m really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. smiling_face_with_hearts ",1
Started medication and so far it's going poorly It's been a couple weeks the first one they had me on gave me mood swings(Doxepine) and the last one(lamotrigine) gave me sleep paralysis which led to the scariest moments of my life to date. So I am fairly discouraged. But they help me sleep so much and I need something to help me from wanting to off myself all day. Right now I'm obsessing over my friends trying not to be too clingy but I love them. They are so important to me. I know killing myself would hurt them and my family so it's not an option for me. But I can't barely get through the day till I see them if I'm lucky enough to see them that day you know? My friend bought me shoes yesterday ones I really wanted but didn't get because my SO didn't think I'd look good in them. They are now my favorite pair. They always do such nice things for me. I feel so weak that all I want to do is be held by my friend and told everything is gonna be ok. When they tell me I'm valid and deserve to be happy I can believe them and the world just melts away. But I understand I can't hangout with them all the time so I need to figure out what to do in the mean time.,1
"February 22nd 2020 I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this. I just don’t feel much except weariness anymore and I’m tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me )",1
Being bad at something stresses me out Just recently a friend of mine started playing chess and I for some reason believe I know how to play any game in the world. So anyways I lost like every single match so far and it's so embaressing. I hate what my friend probably thinks of me. I get so stressed when someone knows I cant do a certain thing. It keeps me up all night thinking about it.,1

"Is it the new implant I got or is it stress? Please help me! So, a few things have started to happen that has caused me to have the worst mental breakdown I’ve ever had at work. But I want to know how they’re related, if they are the cause, and how I can fix it. 1. To start off, I have depression and anxiety. I take medication for it and I’ve not had a problem with them since. Meds work pretty well. 2. For the past 2 months, I’ve been dealing with stress at work with a boss who hardly comes in, and employees that don’t do their job correctly. I also have problems with clients that aren’t happy with how we control things and dogs that shouldn’t BE AT DAYCARE. (doggy daycare). I have to deal with people that can’t do their job and I have to work extra hard to cover for them. We do not have a manager as it’s her business. 3. My mother has recently been diagnosed with cancer. I live 1,000 miles away and finally got to see her after 3 1/2 months of being away (sister had a wedding in august so I was away for about 8months due to the pandemic). She has stage 3 and is on radiation and chemo. It was the first time I seen her look so weak, exhausted, in pain, and grouchy. I didn’t want to leave my mom (even though my dad is taking care of her) and I only got to see her for a week before me and my bf had to go back to our home state. I am very very very close to my mom so all of this and departing from her really broke my heart. 4. I’m very sensitive but I can hold my own. You could say I’m very sweet, supportive but also been isolated from life since I lived most of it in the country. I don’t know certain things and my bf gets very impatient and frustrated with me when I don’t explain things fully or have trouble with things and actions that are common sense. 5. I have diagnosed ADHD and take a large amount of medication for it. Sometime, my medicine doesn’t kick in properly making my brain foggy and my way of thinking is all over the place. This makes my bf upset when he doesn’t get why I’m talking so weirdly or all over the place. 6. And lastly, on December 16th of this year, I switched over to a new form of birth Control, NEXPLANON, or birth control implant, the one that goes in your arm. I’ve been spotting irregularly, breaking out like mad (face usually is clean and clear as a whistle), and I feel like I’m crying more than ever before. Although it DOES seem like it’s my implant, I feel like there is more to this story. Right now, I usually keep my composure when ever my bf gets frustrated, annoyed, or angry with me. I keep it pretty well together. However, tonight, he got frustrated with me, not raising his voice, nothing that shows anger, and.....I felt like bawling. Like super hard core bawling. This is NOT NORMAL. My sleep, eating, drinking, everything else is fine. Nothing is bothering me that usually does. Everything is normal but for some reason I feel like anything could set me off. I’m afraid to go into work and I’m afraid I’m gonna get fired. Please, anyone out there, tell me what’s wrong! I really need to know. I’m desperate!",1
"So stressed about bad decision at work. I work for an insurance company and my job is to accept/decline applicants based on their risk. This one policy is high risk and the agent talked me into giving them more time to fix the issue. Nothing has happened yet but the extension is for a year. Now I’m overwhelmed with the feeling that a large loss will happen and it’ll be all my fault. I know I made a bad decision and there’s nothing I can do now but I don’t know how I’m going to cope with the dread and physical symptoms (racing heart, tight chest, overthinking) and feeling that I let everyone down for a year.

"Can you forget you have depression? I know that sounds kinda dumb. I'm a bit confused and over thinking. Does anyone relate to this feeling like when you get better/in recovery and then nothing is wrong, never has been, everything's fine? and all that shit before was just made up and never happened? It gets played down and trivialized, not by anyone else but in your own mind? I've gone through cycles of depression for years and whenever I feel better I seem to forget just how bad it was, or like I'm in denial or something. But then I think its not that bad surely if I can feel so good and like the world is in HD again. Also when talking to anyone about my depression I just want to laugh at the absurdity of it. I don't like talking about it sometimes because I'm worried people might think I'm making it up, or worse take what I say at face value and believe me! I think I'm making it up. It's a big joke, It's emotional whiplash. But I do feel like this when I'm alone so how can it be a performance and made up? I live like a hermit and have pushed everyone away and don't really connect emotionally anymore. I feel it's all rather dramatic.",1

Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me. Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it? I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on. And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust.",1
"The way I looked at my depression helped me tremendously. I see depression being regarded as a monster, a beast, a fight, and a crushing weight. And I too, for many years, viewed it in those ways. It was hard and at times I felt as I could not ""escape"". One day at my absolute lowest. I decided to change my perspective on it just to see if it would even make a difference. Boy did it. For me, I looked at it like an amusement park and roller coasters. You can sorta guess how this goes, but please allow me to explain Walking through the park, at that level, we feel our baseline ""normal"". The rides represent our mental and emotional highs and lows in life. Everyone walks through the park. For some, that's all they do and they are content. Others get on the gentler rides. They experience both highs and lows but not to extremes, again still content. Then there are the coasters. Many people get on them and then never again. Others, keep riding their favorite one. For me? I was the one rushing between all of them. Running through the park to catch the next. Not staying in my baseline for very long. My depression shared a relationship with those roller coasters. Never staying the same and some bigger or scarier than others. Seeing the highest points between the drop of pure passionate joy. The lows with twists and turns leaving me in fear. And then returning to the station filled with gratitude that it's over safely. But here's were I saw beauty in this...My life is PASSIONATE. Those high points I feel so deeply. Those lows as well. But it's exhilarating through it all. And I know I'll return to the station safe and sound. Bringing friends and family to share in the beautiful moments and hold your hand through the scary. Recognizing my support system that way feels wonderful. And let's not forget therapy or medication (Personally unmedicated but open to it). I look at them like other riders. Especially ones you just can't help but laugh or giggle at when they are over the top or cracking jokes. They help make those fearful moments really not so bad. I just wanted to share this with whomever decides to read this. Just looking at my depression in a different way helped me tremendously in acknowledging and moving forward in where I am and how to handle the difficult times. Does anyone else have any similar methods that helped?",1
"I want to commit suicide soon. I have no one to talk to about this, let me vent here. I have leftover medicines I can overdose on. I just don't know if I need to buy some alcohol so it's more fatal. I had this strong urge to drink them all last night but stopped because my partner in a project tomorrow messaged me. If I were to go last night, I'd bring trouble to her as I have to bring some items. I'll probably do it after that project is done tomorrow and if I still feel the same. Last night, another friend told me about when they tried overdosing and waking up feeling asphyxiated. I played this game where we sent messages anonymously about our feelings and reread an old message where a stranger said they tried overdosing but lived on to regret it. But now I'm still feeling empty and want to end it all. This decision is powered by how I feel like people who I thought were close to me didn't care instead. They didn't reach me out, they stopped replying to my chat even knowing I felt suicidal. Because it's already night and they want to sleep. Maybe I'm selfish for wanting them to stay and comfort me. It's the weekend and there's no work to do... Maybe they think I won't do it as it's not my first time expressing my suicidal tendencies. Been up and down for 2+ years but never really tried because I want to really pass away on my first try. I believe even if I were to go, they won't care. Or they might feel sad for a while and then it will all be better. Things are bad for me. Every single aspect of my life. I feel no happiness being alive. Two years ago I said I'd try and see if things would change. Here I am now, nothing really changes. Should have ended my life years ago. I don't live in the USA so my only concern is how do I give my belongings and bank account without a formal will. I already composed a will 2 years ago, saved in my laptop. I will update it before I go and hope someone can find it and exact my will for me. Life is just not for me.",1

"On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is daily suicidal ideation? Also, if any happy times or feelings arise during self-assumed depression, dors that still mean I am depressed? I've gotten so used to them that I don't even worry about them anymore. Also, it isn't correct to say daily, rather multiple times per day for months, 4 months to date, to be exact. I've never sought formal help, nor do I have someone I trust enough to elaborate on my problems, so I am not sure how long I have been depressed or what the intensity of it was. Like anyone else, even when I thought I was depressed, there were still some happy moments in there somewhere. As such, I also have a second question if any period of happiness is experienced during a period or periods of self-diagnosed depression, does that mean I am not depressed?",1
"Having COVID has revealed to me what I really am Thankfully I am able to hide it from others. So only I know the decaying disease in my thoughts, heart and soul.

There is a lack of humanity within me, a massive selfishness about me. Even when I concentrate on what it ultimately good for others I still find an essence of being self centered, thinking how it benefits me. How am I able to care, but then again care but not care?

"I am starting to become depressed again Sometimes I feel so insane with how swiftly my emotions change. I feel everything so tremendously deep and when the smallest good thing happens (as small as someone holding the door for me or a stranger complimenting my outfit), I feel a strong surge of motivation to make my life better and the good instant happens it consumes me for a couples hours or days depending on what it is and cheers me up some. But all those small good things are irrelevant and mean nothing so as soon as enough time passes, I drop way back down into my depression. When I am living at home it is really easy to focus on me and only care about doing stuff to better myself and prepare to have a successful future. However, at college it is not so easy to ignore how lonely and misunderstood I am.

I don't know when it started but I can date it back to 2014 when my brother died and i actually felt it properly as before that I was going through a rough patch with my mother. As for my mother she is a great woman, very respected, and religious. My father is a great man too, he built himslef up from zero to where he is now. They both love eachother but are also in a very toxic relationship where they hurt eachother. Fom my point of view a lot is expected from me. I changed my nature to be the bubbly one and the comedian of the house after my brothers death although i am an introvert, I started hiding my suffering when i saw my mom suffering due to my brother's loss. I became toatlly differen5 person and my friends even commented on that. I brought the laughters back in house not realizing that i was slowly losing myself. I indulged in emotional eating and started gaining weight but no one was kind, not even my own mother. I also was suffering with the worst acne. So, I developed anxiety which worsened in 2019 where i would start shaking whenever i had to meet someone new or talk to someone on phone. People indirectly , even my own aunts, started commenting on my weight and how i look older than my age. I was 70 kg (155 lbs) (I am 5'4""). I started indulging in not so good practices and developed an eating disorder. I fasted for 2 whole months with just an egg salad without yolk, which was about 260 calories, at the end of the day and even that i purged. I then started eating only soup at night and even vomited that.. all the time i was working out for 4-5 hours a day with my umiversity. I eveb water fasted for 8 days which was broken because my dad was worried and brought pizza for me to eat. Eventually, I did lose weight. I became obsessesd, I knew something was wrong so i started working on myself as when i gathered the courage my dad didn't beleive in eating disorder and told me to hust start eating properly and mom just consoled me and to eat healthy. There were instances where i would wake up at night and gobble rice fron the fidge or two packs of pop corn at 2am in dark while tears poured down my face. I hated myself by tpeople loved the new me. They loved how i looked. And I couldn't help but think that i did the right thing. But i stil stopped as i love my teeth and purging was said to affect them. I then developed stomach ulcer and was put on hunger medication and was said to eat something every 2-3 hours. I did, but i also gained weight. And now again people have started berating me. I am right now preparing for the biggest test for my life. I have always dreamt of it. I know my depression has just kept getting worse. I can feel it. I never thought of killing myself as , as a muslim we are taught suicide is very wrong. But for some time now i have started fantasizing of someone killing me, getting hit by a car, developing a terminal illness and what not. I lost my grandmother earlier this year, i loved her and was myslef her favourite but i just couldn't cry. Why? I don't know. I know i loved her. I did. Recently my mother have started abusing me emotionally.  Every tactic if manipulation and gaslighting she could use to make me feel less, she did. The sad thing is she isn't even realising it. She just seems to think that i am in the wrong. Although, my father clearly told me not to be worried about my weight and just to focus on studies and after exams he'll join the gym with me if needed. He has also said to my mom to help out by being understanding while i am preparing. But she doesn't and i don't want to create another problen between them. Also i have been a mediator vetween both of them in all their fights. I am my mithers therapist. But now I am just fed up. I don't wanna listen to anyone. I just wanna run away. I am so so depressed that i have lost my motivation and don't even know what to do. Please help me out someone. Note I am sorry if some things don't make sense. Please bear with me . I am so overwhelmed with my thoughts and feelings all over the place.",1
"Does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention? I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?",1
"I achieved one goal in 2016. I started brushing my teeth. For the first time in 25 years of life, I brushed my teeth everyday for an entire month straight. I did it you guys. I'm so happy to have one small thing. I don't know how I'll reward myself since I have no money, but I'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good. I hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis. I know you're trying and I admire you for it. I love you all. Happy New Year! ",0
I just feel lost I'm 17 years old male and i'm seeing a therapist once week. I have been suicidal for the past 5 years. My mom is the only one that keeps me away from suicide. I know how bad she would feel about it so i won't do it. I get drunk everytime i possibly can. While im drunk i feel like i can see what makes me so depressed. My girlfriend cheated on me and i feel guilty for that even tho i know i shouldn't . I have been lonely after that. I have got some friends but i feel like most of them actually hate me. I came here to know people got any other ways to feel relieved than self harm.,1
"Chronic stress - seeking support I was under chronic stress for 3+ years which uncovered a mood disorder. I've finally started feeling relief since February and each day is getting better but I still have my bad days when my symptoms get to me. Primarily the uneasiness. My fight or flight mode was turned on for so long that my body and mind are still trying to regulate. I've also been getting help through CBT and meds of course for the mood disorder (I don't want this happening again lol). I don't feel like this is an anxiety disorder, I just feel like this is a symptom of the chronic stress. I am way better than where I was at last year but this road to recovery can get bumpy. Any words of encouragement or personal stories that are similar?",1
"I can feel that my end is near. I know my mental state is going to sink to an all time low in the near future. I'm going insane, i'm lonely to the point of being desperate on dating apps, wasting people's time. Realizing i have to work on myself first, which i know i won't be able to do. I'm isolating myself, i never open up. I play off anything to seem i'm okay enough so that people don't ask. Knowing damn well they still worry about me. But i just can't, i'm tearing up as i'm writing this. Life is just so overwhelming i think i'll end up ending it, some time in the near future. I've had these feelings before, it got better but this time i legit see no possible turning point. I feel like i'm stuck on a raft floating towards a waterfall, with the waterfall being driven insane by loneliness and self hatred and finally getting the courage to put my head through the rope.",1
"My 16 year old daughter went on her first date with the girl she likes She told me near the end of January of this year that she is gay. Since then she's been a lot more sociable and is flashing that gorgeous, radiant smile of hers a lot more often. She called me this morning (her mom has custody on weekends) and told me all about this girl and their date, and it's the happiest I've ever heard her sound. I am so unbelievably proud of my little girl. I'm smiling ear to ear thinking about how happy she must be to be living as her true self. She is my world, and her happiness is my happiness.",0
"I don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression. All the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. Yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. There's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it.",1
"Does anyone eat then feel immense guilt immediately after? When I stay home alone, not wanting to see anyone, ignoring texts, and avoiding socialization, I eat. And every single time, I feel disgusted at myself for eating and vow to stop eating as much. But that shit goes out the window next time I’m hungry and I crave something. Then I look at my gut and hate myself more. It’s a never ending cycle. And I can’t stop drinking. Fucking hate it. But you guys know how it’s just an endless black hole I keep digging myself because of my clinical depression. Yeah, it sounds easy to slap some sense into myself, to motivate myself, but I can’t. It’s been like this for years. I hate eating. But can’t stop. I love drinking. But can’t stop. Sometimes I don’t see the point of all this. Rant over. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this.",1
"Hate when normal people ask me what I've been doing all day and I have to lie. Nothing ok, I lay in my bed depressed and slept till 6pm alright? Sorry I can't be normal and productive like you up at 9am with 50 friends. I'm a creature of darkness and death, you wouldn't understand my life you grew up with a happy loving middle class family. My entire life has been suffering and hate everything. I'm so tired of pretending I have a job and pretending to be normal. I'm exhausted.",1

"Someone asked me out today! (I’m married, but it was a nice mid-day boost!) I was in line at the bakery and the guy next to me started up a conversation. He seemed nice so I chatted with him a while. I got the sense he might want to ask me out so I tried to casually flash my wedding ring, but he didn’t see. After a few minutes he asked me out—I told him thank you but I’m actually married! He was nice about it and we went out separate ways. I haven’t been asked out in a long time—not that I’m looking or course, but it’s nice to know I’ve still got it! Lol",0
Depression is physically painful It literally hurts to live,1
"I (16f) am starting to give up again and I know it's pathetic I've been on this journey of getting better since I was 13. It was going well until I met a boy and he abused me for 6 months. Now im 16. I have ptsd along with my prior diagnosis of depression, bulimia, anxiety, and ocd. Things were getting better for a while a couple months after I finally got away from the boy. When I hit 16 people started asking me what I'm going to do and what I want to be. How am I supposed to know? I was supposed to die 3 years ago but I was saved. I dont know what I'm supposed to do. My boyfriend is my schools big football player and he seems to know just what he wants to do. Me on the other hand? I can barely even walk far anymore. My physical health is declining. I'm in so much physical pain and just want to end it. I have no purpose in life. I want to be something but I cant keep a hobby. I played guitar for a while and was good at it but gave up because I dont want to leave bed. I love music, mainly writing and singing. It the only hobby I still kind of have but I know its a useless one. I tried to be a vtuber. I made the models and they were actually really good but after that I gave up. I even wanted to make and arg or just a tiktok account but I never finish it. I'm the problem. I hate myself. I hate how I'm fat (150 5'4), I hate my deep voice for a girl, I hate my face, I hate my birth defect, I hate everything about me. I try to be a cute, pink, kawaii catgirl because thats what I want to look like. I'm too fat for the cute, pink, kawaii clothes. The cat ears I own are black and through the look of but mainly I just end up making the cat ears look ugly. I'm absolutely pathetic. I have no meaning or purpose. The only thing I'm good at is loving my boyfriend.",1
"I don’t know how to be a college student I’m a first generation college student (First-born in US, first in family to go to college) pursuing an engineering degree who has no idea what the hell is going on. I messed up a lot last semester and ended with a below-average GPA, and this semester things are slightly better but I’m still nowhere near where I should be. I’m studying and going to classes from the morning until 1 or 2 AM every day, and I’m still not doing as well as all my friends. I’m constantly sad and stressed out and I don’t know what to do. I feel like a complete failure. I’ve been paying for college on my own, and at this point I’m just trying so hard just so keep the scholarships I have. My mom wants to get a second job so she can help me pay for my school, but it’s the last thing I want her to do. To pay for college, this summer I have to work 45+ hours a week for three months on top of summer classes (calculus and physics) so I don’t stay behind in the curriculum and graduate in four years. My entire academic life is a huge mess and I have no idea how to deal with it. Its gotten to the point where its all I think about, to the point where I now have depression and anxiety, and I haven’t told anyone about it. I don’t know how to deal with all of this.",1
"I envy people who can afford to be happy Currently, I can't afford being happy, nor extreme happiness anymore. Every time I experience something to be happy about, when it tones down, it goes down hard. I feel extreme depression after that. But when I feel neutral, it just continues, not happy, but at least not feeling the depression. I don't know what to do because I genuinely enjoy the happiness whenever it is happening. But I also know I'm going to crash hard after that. So now I just try not to feel extreme happiness and continue being neutral just so I wouldn't crash. Just last night, I really enjoyed my time hanging out with my close friend and it's not even euphoric, I was just glad that time. But now, I crashed and I don't know what to do. ",1
"How do I plan for burnout, while also hiding the burnout from others? I’ve been stressed lately due to overworking and other things. I think I’m at the point where I’m not gonna escape the eventual burnout. It’s just a matter of being prepared and wondering when its going to happen. So how do I prepare myself? What loose ends do I need to tie before I don’t care for an unforeseeable amount of time? I’ve already prepared some stuff that will release online on a schedule (I make content online). And how do I do it without anyone in my family catching on that something is wrong (I know I shouldn’t hide it, but I’d rather not let them know).",1
"Old heartbreaks can eventually just be nice memories I'm sure that this doesn't apply to every situation, but it made me happy to think about today. I thought about my first girlfriend this morning. It was actually because of hearing a song we used to listen to all the time, just driving around our little home town. We were both 16 when we met, and we were together for nearly 2 years. It was a classic story, she got into college in a different state, I couldn't afford to go to college yet, we planned to stay together long distance and it lasted about 3 months. Breaking up with her ruined both of us at the time of course for a few months, that first person you fall in love with does a number on you. I was pretty miserable for a while. For years when I thought about it, it would make me a little sad. Especially if I was single at the time. Then I really never thought about it at all. This was probably the first time I thought about her in as long as I can remember, maybe years (I'm 30 now). This time though I didn't feel sad at all, everything I remembered was a happy memory. The first time we kissed, which was the first time either of us had kissed anyone. Doing absolutely everything together. Sneaking out just to see each other for a few minutes. Climbing an old fire tower in our town, laying out in a field under the stars together. Falling asleep together for the first time. Carrying her around for no reason. Planning all the trips we would never end up going on together. Also, just that overwhelming feeling of wanting to be near someone, and the joy I'd feel when her car would pull up or when she would walk out of her front door to meet me. It's all just nice fun stuff, and it doesn't really matter to me anymore that it didn't work out, and I don't really remember the painful part of it ending. I'm just glad it happened, it was probably the best part of my childhood and young adult years and you can't get that back. In my mind she was the most beautiful, smartest, and funniest person I had ever met, and I couldn't believe when all those feelings were reciprocated. Even if it didn't last, we loved each other. Not everyone gets to experience being in love with someone at 17, its such a pure and simple thing, and I think I'm pretty lucky.",1

"I want to dissapear I don’t know...Lately I just lost alot of friends suddenly I was the *bad guy* and my best friend of 6 years left me, because she couldn’t stand me not being taking care of myself (depression) and she had to take card of herself for knce (I totally get it) but she left me on read for 3 weeks now....my new friends who I met last year left me, because I didn’t share my personal experiences I had with my ex bf. And they pressured me to go to therapy bc of my depression which I did bc I wanted to make them happy..but despise all that they just thought I was acting innocent and lying about everything... Its been 4 months... I’ve always loved big buildings and I’ve always wanted to live in the city. I would look at different skyscrapers and be like “One day” Hell...now I look at the buildings and I just think to myself “not high enough” I’m so messed up rn... I know those “friends” don’t mean much but they still have friends and I have no one..why am I the only one without friends by my side??? Maybe I deserved it.. all of it",1
"Just a bunch of first world problems I’m a freshman in college. I was one of those people who did well in high school without really trying. I knew it would be harder coming into college but a great first semester pulled me into a false sense of security. I’m currently sitting on a 3.1 (seriously, why are B’s so fucking detrimental?). This would be fine(ish), since I’m a comm major and nobody in my field of work (especially in my city) gives a shit about your academics in college. You can either do the job or you can’t. Problem is, my scholarships and aid are riding on my grades. I can’t afford to go to college without them. I never learnt proper studying or time management skills so I’m trying desperately to catch up, but I’m being buried under classes, orgs, and general life responsibilities. I stupidly thought that managing 12 hrs with only one class that has tests and no orgs meant I could do 15 hrs with three classes that test. Haha nope. I joined four orgs and paid the dues for all of them. Two of them I never attend because I don’t have time, so that’s $80 down the toilet. One of them wants too much time and the other is confusing and point opportunities are hard to come by. For the past two weeks the meetings that normally go until 8 30 have been running up on 10 30 instead. I’m trying to take care of things that would actually help me, like doctor and psych appointments. Doing this means I’m missing classes, meaning my grades suffer. I’m not seeing a therapist anymore because I don’t have time. There are so many things I have to do, fees I have to pay, papers I have to fill, etc. and I can’t do them all. My family says exercise and eat well. In what time? How do I stick to my calories when I’m constantly binging from stress? I’m getting back to my old weight and I hate it. I can’t stand the idea of anyone seeing me naked, so a love life (as if I’d have time for it) is out of the question. I’ll spend all day working and then realize I accomplished almost nothing because I was agonizing over a single task. But I need to be a perfectionist with these things because they are such a huge part of my grade. None of the things I do are interesting to me. I’m in an English and theatre course and I either hate them or can’t give them the dedication I want, despite the fact that I love those subjects. After every test I make a plan to study better but it quickly gets thrown to the wayside as other shit is piled onto my plate. So now I’m cramming and stressing. My room is a disaster. My side is always dirty because I’m too overwhelmed to pick it up. My roommate is a super light sleeper so I have to go to bed before I can finish my stuff just so she can get her sleep. And it’s not her fault, but I just want to yell “I’m sorry you can’t sleep, but I have shit to do. Let me fix my shitty GPA while you enjoy your 3.9, thanks.” This isn’t the half of it, but what I can get down before I have to get back to work. I’m sure some of these things have easy solutions but I’m too blinded by my stress, sadness, frustration, everything. I welcome any advice anyone may have. These problems are stupid and unimportant in the grand scheme of things, but I can’t ignore them. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this and just see me and how I feel.",1
"This class The class I am taking is taking everything out of me. I am only 18 but I've taken college classes before. This is NOT my first semester. I know how to study. I know what kind of learner I am. This isn't my first rodeo. This class is 10 credit hours and mandatory as part of my degree/program. The 10 credit hours doesn't scare me either. Two of the classes I've already taken have been 10 credit hours. But this class, It takes everything out of me. My instructor is the world's greatest dick, totally uncaring, inflexible, and rambles about nonsense all the time. He is a stereo typical manly man and very self centered and egotistical. Surprisingly so considering the feild that this class is for.He says there are no dumb questions but will often make you feel bad and really dumb for asking a question. On the rare instance he doesn't gaslight you, he rambles and doesn't really answer the question and leaves you more confused then you were in the start. Very, very, verrrryyyy rarely has he ever answered a question properly. He expects you to already be an expert in an entry level class. The fact that we are living through covid and do most of our classes online doesn't help either. I am not an online learner. I've spoken with other people in the class and it is mutual that everyone is struggling and they all hate the man. I've spoken to many professionals in the field. They all agree and empathize with me. I even had one person told me that my instructor ""doesn't know what the hell he's doing when it comes to teaching"". I Know part of the blame lies on me. But I went from a straight A student to getting Cs on all my tests. Cs get degrees but in my class i need a B or higher to pass. Everytime I log on to lecture or go to class I end up crying at some point. I cry atleast 4 times a week. I cant drop the class because my family paid for it and are really proud of me. I cant waste their money. We dont have the money to waste. I feel terrible. My parents never went to school so they don't understand how hard it is either. I feel so alone. I have no time to do anything but homework and go to work. I have no outlet and am not allotted one. I can't see my friends, my girlfriend, my family. Anyone out side of my coworkers, customers, my parents, and my instructor. Even if I had the time Covid does not allow it. I just got home from class and I am getting a massive migrain (comeing back from the one last night). I went to take my migraine medications and in doing so the water bottle sprayed all over me prompting me to go into my room and ball my eyes out. I have no doubt this class will prepare me for my career. But it will do so in the way that getting stabbed in the face prepares you for a punch in the gut. I can not leave this situation. I have to finish out this class. I have no choice but to take this class. I have no idea what to or how to handle all this stress. I am open to all suggestions; study tips, time management, stress management, anything. I have a 500 word essay due by midnight tonight. Wish me luck, guys.

"So stressed that I was really crying about holes in the wall Hi everyone just wanted to dump some thoughts out. So I’m taking organic chemistry over the summer! I took ochem 1 earlier in the summer and managed to get an A, however, I’m in ochem 2 now and it’s REALLY kicking my ass. I’m so stressed about it. Not only that, summer session won’t end until August 15th and my current apartment lease ends on July 31st. My next lease at the new apartment doesn’t start until August 23rd & they won’t let me move in early. Therefore I had nowhere to stay for the two weeks of August and I didn’t have a friend that had room available for me to crash at. I booked a hotel last minute with my roommate (she’s in the same situation bc she’s taking ochem 2 as well) and we have to move out in a few days. So now I’m stressed about moving out and making sure everything is in tip top shape so I can get my deposit back right. I’m also stressed because I won’t have room in the hotel for all my stuff and I wouldn’t want to have it sitting in my car for so long. I’m racking my brains trying to find people to ask if I could store some stuff at their place. I also have my ochem 2 exam on Monday and I’m barely grasping the concepts. Not only that, my depression has been creeping back due to some repressed trauma resurfacing so it’s just made everything ten times harder and honestly just more magnified. I was taking everything down from the walls and was using this tube of some paste that my dad gave me to patch the holes from nails/screws. I had already finished patching up most of the holes until I finally read the tube and turns out that it’s not made for walls. I don’t know anything about construction-y kind of stuff so I started freaking out. I guess that that was my tipping point because I was really sitting on my floor having a crisis and crying over holes in the wall. Fast forward to now! I’ve gotten the right paste needed to patch the holes and have finished going over them. In retrospect, everything is just funny at this point. Like I was really sitting there crying about holes in the wall HAHA",1

When you are stressed out do you tend to snap easier? Sometimes when I interact with people they seem to get upset at the smallest things. I haven't done anything except ask a question or tried to engage in a friendly conversation and I get a negative response. It feels like I've done something wrong or but I feel like I'm dealing with sour apples who are under a lot of stress.,1

So you either give up and don't eat or force down something that is completely unsatisfying. That is every part of my life right now. I don't know how else to explain it. I have energy now (with my meds) and an urge to be doing something, but nothing seems appealing. When I do things, I don't feel good about it or pleasure. But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something. I don't know what to do or how to explain it. EDIT Holy crap. Thank you everyone for the likes and awards and comments.

"Stress been building up I don't feel stress most of the time but my body has been piling it up. It's reached to the point where I mainly zone out and ignore it. But the moments where I'm in present moment it comes to hit me like a brick. It's not really a healthy way of coping but I always feel like I have to suck it up and press on. I've felt super burnt out from jobs past year and a half. Covid hasn't helped and partner didn't have an income anymore as he wasn't being called in. I managed to find a job I wanted to be in for at least a year - full time. Transitioning to full time felt more taxing. I'm still enjoying it but now I'm stuck just home and work. When I come home I'm completely out of it. 3 weeks ago my partner broke up with me. We lived together, now I have to find a new place as it's too expensive long term for me to keep up. I have to organize handing in me notice+ movers+ cleaners and brace myself for packing. Everything is just building. Taking care of my cat is my top priority as it's another living being that relies on me. I have my first ever appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow over the phone. Needed one for awhile but kept putting it off as thought it was too expensive or I'll be fine once I sort myself out. Think it greatly contributed to a dying relationship and I feel guilty.

Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you? Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.,1

"This Year has been a Sh*tShow Where to begin. 1. Found out a ""friend"" has been backstabbing me (which i already sorta knew) 2. Had a(n ex) coworker threaten his life and the wellbeing of others (while he is gone now, the stress of him randomly showing up still lurks) 3. Rough 8 months of a relationship, with a guy I really love; he is struggling with his life, and it has affected my life (we are working on it and the past month has been okay, but the stress of the last 8 still linger). 4. Guilted into a family vacation I didn't want; I had fun, but everything before and after was just hell. 5. My cat has been on and off sick all year, and it is destroying me financially. 6. I have been led on by a corporation for a ""real job"", only to not get it (I had three interviews, they suggested I had the job, and then they didn't even bother to call me \[i called them!\] to tell me I didn't get it) 7. Got rejected from a ""real job"" because I had a Master's (remember that lie we grew up with? Degrees get jobs? BS) 8. Political and environmental shit has been staying up at night 9. Had a friend block me on everything because we had different opinions on how the police issue in AMerica should be handled; she wouldn't even talk it out with me. Now I'm a ""horrible person"" even though she didn't get the full side of my opinion. 10. My mom revealed she is going to cheat on my step-dad. I cut her out of my life, cuz I'm sick of her self-sabotaging and insensitive bs; she is making me pay, literally, by demanding money I owe her from something she gifted me months ago. She doesn't even need the money; she's rich. She is doing it out of spite, and sending me harassing mail. 11. My car was broken into last night. 12. Got into a fight with a friend about her ignorance on the topic of mental health; it's not like I have a degree in it or anything.... oh wait. I do. Things have been awkward in the friend group for the last few months because of it. 13. Had family members lose their homes due to tornadoes I honestly am not okay. My mental emotional health has been terrible this year. Yes, I am getting help. NO, it isn't working. I don't see the point in staying in a world that's basically falling apart.",1
"Fuck all of this I'm stuck at home. I have nothing to do. I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside. All my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). My physical condition is worse than ever before. Every part of my body hurts. As soon as I start to break down or cry, I get yelled at even more. I feel like I'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. I have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy. Edit Thank you guys so much for all the kind words.

Anyone else casually want to die all the time? I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things. somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. ,1

"My therapist committed suicide Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?” I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair.

"I’m so embarrassed I can’t envision a future for myself that’s it’s affecting my relationships I’m envious of everyone around me. Even envious of the old me. I used to have goals and aspirations. Now all I do is sleep. I used to be smart, bright, had so much to say about the world and would easily slip into witty banter with my friends. Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore. I want to smile genuinely. I want to feel that spark of interest. Nothing. I don’t see anything and I’m jealous of my brother and my cousin. They used to be the delinquents who got subpar grades and I was the golden child. Now the roles are reversed and I feel like they’re constantly looking down on me. I’m so ashamed I can’t keep living like this.",1
"Stress/burnout breakdown thanks to my job I'm the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted. I work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing, taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9 p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge. My worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot. Besides all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of what's happening. For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling * restless * heavy chest * couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work) * I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry * crying really, really easily * questioning about my work and myself * isolating myself * easily forgetting any information * walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious I asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients. I tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings. I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this? Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away. Ps Sorry for my English, it's not my first language. TL;DR I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.",1
"Is it stress, or is our relationship dead? My fiancé is constantly stressed about work. For at least the last year. He’s so stressed that he throws up in the mornings and has work related nightmares and sleep shouts. He hates his colleagues, his work and he comes home in a foul mood. I try my best not to take things personally but he’s lost all interest in me and pushes me away. Both emotionally and physically. His excuse is always “I’m tired”. He tells me he loves me but then dismisses me if I have an opinion or request or any interaction with him. He used to be sweet, sending me cute selfies and giving me compliments. Now our interaction is mostly food related. Unless it’s the weekend in which case we’re probably arguing. I’m exhausted fighting with him. He says hurtful things which make me think this relationship is dead, like “just when I thought this relationship was going to work you start another fight”. Also his lack of desire to plan our future, our wedding, our children. Instead it’s, “I’m tired” “you only want kids because your friends have them” “I can’t plan ahead, it gives me anxiety”. I don’t know what to make of it. How much is stress and I just need to be more understanding, and how much is just him not really wanting the relationship anymore...?",1
"How to deal with debilitating stress at work? Hi all! I’m new around here, but think we can all use a safe space to talk about stress and over advice ) I need some advice I started a new job about two months ago. Things were going well for the first month, I struggle a lot with stress at work, holding myself to high expectations, and inability to deal when I mess up, but was using this opportunity to focus on changing my internal thoughts re work. Then COVID-19 hit and I started working remotely, it went well at first but the last two weeks a lot has been happening in my personal life and I feel stressed to that point that I can barely function, much less focus on work and it’s hard being at home and unable to separate my work life from my personal life. This week it finally got bad enough that I talked to my boss and coworkers about it, as I know my ability to work has suffered. I make lots of small mistakes, forget things, have constant headaches, can’t remember what I’ve done, etc. My brain basically feels like it’s broken. My boss said to be easy on myself, but to make sure that I’m doing good work and contributing value to the organization, I know she cares that I’m struggling but also has high expectations. She’s frustrated and I am too, but I’m truly at a loss of what to do. It’s a small team so asking to take on fewer responsibilities doesn’t seem like an option, and I’d feel selfish doing that so soon into my new position, but I don’t feel like I can keep doing this. Any advice? Either for helping with focus or talking with my boss. Thank you!",1

"My sister saved my life yesterday. There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know.

"Back in the fog again Didn't think I'd be back here again as I thought things in my life were suddenly looking up. I'm currently a semi-professional athlete who's looking to make it full-time. Its been my dream for a very long time and to people on the outside it looking that way. However due to injury plus the pandemic I've effectively missed two years of playing. I'm 26(M) and I feel like I've put in a lot of time and effort for very little return. It makes me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time focussing on this one thing and seriously brings me down. Coupled with that I've been battling serious anxiety issues since I was in primary school, I worry loads about the future and struggle to think far ahead. I've pursued sports relentlessly as it was the only thing that gave me pure joy and what I thought I was good at. Also making it would provide significant financial reward. Seeing friends on social media excel in their respective careers and enjoy life has made me feel as though I've wasted a lot of time and adds to my depression. It also Makes me feel as though I'm not as worth much to people because I'm not doing big thing so I'm not good enough to be around them and more importantly I'm not worth much to myself. Since I was young I've never really had people think I could amount to much (aside from my mum) of whom I extremely want to make proud. But overall it has hugely imlacted my mental health to points where I doubt myself and end up asking myself if I've even learnt anything during my time of living. I also feel as though since we're now slowly coming out of the pandemic, life as gotten better for most (which is good) but somehow worse for me which may be naive to think but it appears to be that way. To the point whereby I struggle to have simple conversations with people, I don't find things as funny anymore and my attention to detail on things has gone out the window . I even feel when writing this message I'm not articulating myself the best as my brain is in a fog at the moment. Doing things such as getting out of bed is becoming an issue but I feel bad each time if I'm wasting time. I'm struggling to make sense with reality and it's becoming very overwhelming. I don't have money to see a therapist as I quit my job in Sales due to the stress it was bringing and the way it was affecting my performance in sport. Overall I've some how wound up in another depressive episode and it seems to be the worst. I thought I was mentally becoming more resilient after okay for a good amount of time but I just feel lost and confused and it's all happening at a time when things should be going well. For people who have experience dealing with this or can relate to this situation in any type of way, what did you do to cope with it and change your lives for the better and permanent.",1

Everything that can happen after this isn't going to be the same if I can't enjoy it with my little buddy. I'm stuck working a menial job and I feel empty while I do it. I'm on the verge of crying all of the time but I've pretty much cried myself out at this point. Every day I wake up I remember that I'm living in a world without my buddy I'm so tired all of the time but I'm trying to keep it together, but I know that if I don't distract myself then I'll start questioning what the point in even living is.

"Losing Everything My current fiancé has been wanting to move out recently and take my daughter with her. I have not been the best fiancé of all time, but by no means an awful one either. I can’t imagine not having either one of them in my life and don’t think I could live without both of them. They mean the absolute world to me and to not have them would leave me with nothing. I keep begging her not to, but believe that if I want her to be happy she might need to. I am stuck in the cross roads here of losing everything including myself, or keeping her around to potentially not be as happy as she should. I am willing to make an immediate lifestyle change for her, she just doesn’t believe me. I want them in my life forever and would be left with absolutely nothing if they were to walk out anytime",1

My memory is terrible now, I can't stay focused, I feel frozen in panic most of the time. I literally feel mentally damaged. I've felt like I have nothing left for my child or husband when I get home because I'm mentally drained. Last week I decided I can't live like this anymore and I resigned!

"Does anyone else live in their own head? I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out.

Yesterday was a day of technical difficulties all day. I ended up going into the office (I usually work at home). I’m trying to start a side business, really a full time business if possible, aside from my job to make more money. After work, I work on that. So, essentially, I probably work 60 hours a week.

"Losing my house but I’m going to be okay Dear kind souls of Reddit, I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter. I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem. The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this. I have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing, but I have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for several months, I am under so much stress, and I am furious. I have been living in a hotel since March while I am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that I can’t live in. Why does the world work this way?",1
"How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it?? One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I'm lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time?? Anyone have any advice?",1
"I never thought that I could do it, but yesterday I got my college acceptance letter! I've been struggling in community college for about four years now. Ever since the beginning of high school, school has been super hard for me even though I was a star student before that. About a year ago, I got diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder, depression, and OCD. After talking it through with my therapist and psychiatrist, we came to the conclusion that I've had these mental illnesses undiagnosed for about ten years. School has always been so intimidating for me because nobody in my family went to college so I didn't really have any help, plus I was scared because I have such low self esteem and didn't think I could make it. But I did! I got my acceptance letter yesterday for the university that I want to go to! I know it's not over yet and I still have a lot of work to do, but I'm really proud of myself for getting here.",0

"What's the ""real"" problem with me... I've always wondered why I never had any friends. It's been an unfortunate consistency throughout my life. I'm moderately attractive with good personal hygenie. I'm very generous with my time and money. I will bend over backwards for the people in my life that I care about and love. I'm genuine, honest, trustworthy, empathetic, compassionate and loyal. However, nobody wants to be my friend...not even when I was a child. I'm almost 53 years old and have never had a best friend that I could trust and rely on. I've had people that I knew at work or school and we seemed to get along well enough. However, they would never accept my invites to go hang out and do fun things together. I've heard that if the problem is ""across people"", that means everywhere you go and all the people you meet...then it's ""you"". In the beginning, I brushed it off and thought I was just dealing with a bad person or our personalities didn't match up...etc. But...now that I'm nearly 53, the issue seems much deeper and I'm trying to unravel the true issue here. I've had really nice cars and a nice house to host a party or social event...nobody agrees to come over. They are all too busy...all the time. It's always some excuse as to why they aren't available. I've become extremely aware of my myself emotionally and I've taken the time to listen to others. I will hear someone say, ""No"" to me, but then...I will hear them agree to hang out with another person, and the excuse they gave me never came up. (Example I will ask someone to go to a movie and they will say something like...""I just have too much to do. Thanks for the invite, but maybe another time"". Another person will ask them to do something on the same day and they will say, ""Sure...yeah, I would really like that. Sounds like fun. I'll see you at 7 30). I scratch my head and think, ""What is so bad about me that nobody wants to spend time with me?"" That type of thing has happened more times than I can count. I've even started to experiment with things and say...""Hey, wanna have lunch tomorrow? I'll pay for everything...let's just hang out and have a good time"". The answer is still...""Thanks for asking, but my wife has all these errands she wants me to do tomorrow. Sorry man"". I pretty much make it irresistible and they still say ""No"". I'm just perplexed. I'm beyond puzzled. I don't get it. I can't even get a friendship started because it takes two to make that work....you know? Anyway, I don't really know what advice I'm searching for on here. I guess I just wanted to air it out. Everyone needs friendship. It's something you crave like food, hydration or sleep. It's a very natural part of life, but for some reason, it's just never been available to me. I feel exceedingly alone and unworthy. I've even bluntly asked people to tell me the truth, but they always spin up some excuse as to why they aren't available, the timing is off, the weather, their wife has errands they need to run, they aren't feeling well, maybe next week...etc...etc. Thanks for listening and maybe there is someone out there with a similar story.",1

"I just can't seem to handle this anymore I'm a sophomore in high school. I get good greats, participate etc. etc. But I feel so over worked this semester. I'm part of the school show and this is our tech week. I feel like it should be a Friday but its only Tuesday, I had two projects due yesterday for my Honors Humanities courses, neither of which I was able to get finished due to the tech week. On top of that I play JV tennis (First year), do scouting (5th year), take tap dancing lessons (11th year), and practice both Piano (12th year) and Violin (8th year). And not to brag but I do them all quite well. I run all A s in high school with the occasional B in math. But I just feel like my way of life is falling apart around my ears. And that's just the first level of stress. The second level is both stress and fear. Myself and a group of people have been running a in depth study of the death of Michael Hastings. And its finally getting to me. I myself have poured in over 600 hours on this project since mid December acting as a defacto leader for the group since we have no proper administration. We are intending to go public relatively soon and its finally started to hit home just how deep we are into this project. You could say that this project is the root of all my stress. So the logical thing to do would be to leave the project quietly. And that's where we hit the problem. If I where to back down from this now, not only would it have been a tremendous waste of my time, it would also be similar to if I saw someone preform a fatal hit and run, I saw the licences plate, got a picture of it, but then decided to not give the picture to authorities. I've always been the kind of person who manages their emotions well, (that's why I'm an admin on several discord servers, I don't discriminate and I don't favor any parties), but as of late I feel like I'm always on the verge of breaking down, stopping whatever I'm doing and just crying until I can't anymore. I haven't quite been able to pinpoint why I want to cry so hard, but its getting to the point where I'm occasionally tearing up over the simplest phrases like, ""how's your day going"". Please someone help.",1
"I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can.

I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out. I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself. I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem?

I've dealt with it for so long that it's almost become background noise mixed in with all of my other anxious thoughts. I know it isn't good for me to bottle them up but at the same time I'm sick of speaking out about feeling like killing myself to my friends and family. It makes me look like an attention whore and it just pushes everyone away.

"I was raised a bigot and tonight I got to pay for my first openly gay friends dinner. I’m incredibly happy with who I’ve become over the past 10 years and just wanted to share with someone. I was raised in a small town where diversity was not celebrated. My family was very anti homosexuality so I ended up doing the same. I moved out and went to my states University where I met the first person to logically call me out on my shit. I said, “no homo” because that was a thing at the time, and he justifiably called me out. Became good friends and even lived together for a year. I ended up dropping out of school to work, moved out and lost touch with him. In the 10 years since I’ve met the best friends in my life who are an interracial married gay couple. Growing up a straight white male in the environment I did, this was not something I thought would happen. I am ashamed to admit but in middle school I argued all gay people should be sent to an island separate from the world. I blame the sheltered town I lived in but mostly myself for accepting that reality where nobody told me it was an incredibly hateful, insensitive idea. Tonight I went to dinner with my best friends and saw my first openly gay friend at a table across the room. I didn’t want to intrude on his groups dinner and I’m a coward so I simply asked the waiter to anonymously pay for his tables meal. My friends were surprised and I got to enjoy an incredible moment explaining that if it wasn’t for my original friendship with that man, that I wouldn’t be enjoying this dinner with them at all. I very well could have still been a sheltered racist bigot. I am smiling wide in reflection of how I’ve grown and am genuinely happy. Thanks Wayne.",0

"It's just another day, but my girlfriend might as well be Wonder-woman My girlfriend is a nurse and works three twelve hour overnight shifts in a row during the week. She lives in Seattle while I am in Portland. We take turns visiting over the weekend at each other's homes. When I first met her, I had switched up my schedule to wake up at 5am to go to the gym and work on my MA before going on with my day. I was having difficulty keeping to the regime and when I told her, she promised to make sure I got up every day at 5am and to hold me accountable to get these things done. Every day for the last six weeks, that is what she has done, whether it be to call me during one of her shifts, or setting her alarm to wake up when I would wake up. Four weeks ago she started sending me a coffee via Uber Eats or making me one when I finished my gym routine and whatever I needed to do with my MA for the day. They say it's the small things that matter in relationships, not necessarily the big gestures or grand proclamations of love. I've found with her it's true. There's so many other thing little things she does and they speak so much in volume about her. I had a stressful meeting with a venture capitalist over the weekend and she wrote on a sticky note, ""You got this! ),"" putting if on my laptop. I only noticed it as I was pulling out my laptop and sitting down for the meeting. She just smiled and winked at me before leaving the room. I just came back from a booking today to find Panda Express on my porch from her... she's pulling overtime today with extra twelve hour shift and she still found the time to send me some freaking food because I hadn't eaten anything yet today. At this point, I am astutely and thoroughly blown away by her. I am pretty much head over heels in love with her at this point. The size of her heart is only outmatched by the size of her brain and my want to keep her laughing at my lame ass puns until she is hoarse.",0
"Turning 16 is fucking stressful Turning 16 is supposed to be fun and exiting, except it’s not, atleast for me. I’ve been so worked up about passing my G1 test that I have literally cried to my mom because I don’t think I’m gonna pass, and it’s just gonna be a waste of $140, on top of that, nobody asked me what I wanted for my birthday when there are a few things that I really need. I don’t know how to deal with this stress.",1
"I've tried so incredibly hard and I've finally made it! I'm here! I'm smiling again. It's the smallest thing to have gratitude for but I have decided to get help despite my fear of it. I'm in hospital, hopefully all will be better this time. I've got plenty to live for. I (15M) have had a great of help and have been beaten down by my depression. Every day is a battle whether it's to bathe or eat healthy or anything else. A woman saved my life last night and I'm eternally grateful for her. For the first time in a while I am focused on my dreams and I'm no longer motivated to prove everyone wrong but to rather prove myself that I'm stronger than I thought.",0
"My life is great, why do I feel down? I wanna start off my saying a bit about me. I'm a 19 year old \[male\] in first year of uni -(Maths&Physics) and I've played the piano since I was six, produce music (some of which is now on spotify) and i am a ""triathlete"" (train 12-15 hours/week) ps. running is my entire life - though I'm not great at it yet. My flatmate, Wendy, is one of my best friends. Over the pandemic we spent around 5 months living on our own (in the same bed since not in uni halls) and everything was great. I have never been in a relationship and I am not ready for one, I made that crystal clear to her before I even invited her to stay with me over the 5 months. We had somewhat a physical relationship, though we never had sex. She asked why and the main was because I didn't want to lead her on, I told her that and would regularly check if she was okay living with me despite not having an emotional relationship - I know that wouldn't work for some people and I really liked spending my time with her. Throughout this time I didn't see anybody from uni (I was home) though I kept in close contact with a girl called Lisa. I picked up a few running and cycling injuries and had to give up training for a few weeks and it fucking broke me (still recovering, but doing much better). Recently, Wendy told me she is in love with me. I friendzoned her and immediately stopped anything physical that we had ever done - I really want this friendship to work. But she is NOT okay. i have spent 3 nights over the past two weeks (where I go to sleep at 4am, waking up at 7am for training) with her as she's having a panic attack . I am trying everything I can. She is now back home since my mum (a qualified counsellor) conviced here that staying in uni is not a good idea - though Wendy wouldn't listen to me when I said it. On top of this, my cycling injury is now back and I am picking up a bad shoulder from swimming and S&C work. Music rooms aren't open and so I haven't practiced piano in a month (which is a big fucking deal). I can't run/cycle/swim how I would like to, I can't practice music and I have no motivation to produce. I hate my uni degree (it's really hard and i have no motivation) though I know when out of this rut I will begin to enjoy it again. And, worst of all, I can't stop thinking about Lisa. I thought I didn't want a relationship but she is fucking everything to me. What is Wendy gonna do when she knows how I feel about Lisa? I'm scared she's gonna do something severe. I don't know if I'm falling inlove with Lisa but all I know is that I would die for her. You're probably wondering why I have titled this what I have, but I can do a lot of great things (cocky, I know) and yet I still look in the mirror and see a 'failure'. I just want to be satisfied with who I am but I have no love for myself. I have dealt with ""depression"" (not really, but feeling constantly down for months on end) and a developing ED which I have now overcome - I don't want it to come back. ps. I can't talk about this in person, I have not told anybody how I feel, I have tried so many times but I just see it as weak and pathetic (never cried infront of anyone sober either).",1
"Stress post-car accident Background; My actual car is a manual and it got reversed into the other day so driving an automatic hire car) Last night I was driving with my girlfriend back to her house and I felt a bit sick in the stomach and was just sitting in silence, I was in my own world stressing about my car and life in general - I was driving at about 80-90km/h and for the first time ever I mistakenly thought I was still in my own car and as something went into my eye I went to downshift so I could keep a bit of control and speed whilst I fix my eye and I hit the break with my left foot. In the 1 second it took to process everything and think about everything that was going on and as I was going to take my foot off the break the car that was behind me smashed into us and caused a 4 car accident. Yes, it was a very honest mistake, it was the first time it’s ever happened and I thank God no one was seriously hurt. The car behind me seemed too close but I just can’t help being depressed about the whole situation; if I would’ve stopped at a service station earlier or been in a different lane would it still have happened? Am I the one at fault because I made that small mistake? Why did it have to happen when my girlfriend was in the car with me? Just why? I feel like everyone has the right to push me down and say I’m in the wrong and I feel everyone should criticise me and make me feel like the piece of trash I am. People keep saying accidents happen and sometimes God puts us through things we don’t understand and that they’ve done the same thing too when driving an automatic but I can’t help but feel like they’re just taking pity on me and don’t want me to feel bad when I should. TLDR; Was the front car in an accident and I don’t think I’m at fault but can’t help but feel like I am. Just need some help on how to stop stressing and feeling like this.",1
"How can you tell if you’re lazy or just depressed? I’ve had depression since I was 15 (I’m 29) so it kinda just feels like part of my personality at this point. I never have any interest in getting up to do anything. I know that not wanting to eat, shower, get out of bed, leave the house, etc is part of depression. But I can’t help but think that I might have been a lazy person before this. I can’t remember tho. I was always at home and I went out of my way to make sure I was alone. I was always on my laptop or watching tv when I was younger. Idk.. I could have just had undiagnosed depression but I’m not sure. Really I just wanna figure out how I could know if this is all just depression or if I’m just a lazy person in the first place? I think it’s just depression because when I have good days all I wanna do is go somewhere and talk to friends and family. But it doesn’t feel like it’s just my depression. Idk. How can someone tell?",1
"Psychologist asked me what my inner child looks like. I drew this. Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave. I drew [this]( afterwards. I can't draw, but I hope someone else can relate to it.

Tremors from stress? Just out of curiosity. Has anyone experienced very slight internal or external tremors under high times of stress? I just noticed it today for myself.

"Depression turned me into an idiot. I used to be quite a bright kid, at least, according to what everyone said. After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day. If I can ever beat depression, would I have any hope of restoring my cognitive ability at all?",1
"I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did. Edit this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes . Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward.",1
"can't do anything for more than 30 minutes without feeling completely drained and going back to bed I'm so embarrassed from my family seeing me lying in bed all day but there is nothing on this earth I'd rather be doing, I literally cannot move from my bed.

I take antidepressants as well as other drugs prescribed by my psychiatrist but they dont do anything if not make me feel even more horribly.

Sometimes my boss can sense it and will give me a long weekend and I’m fine for one day after then feel burned out again. I’m usually a highly productive person and the inability to concentrate and effectively meet the goals I have in the past is making me feel like a failure. Has anyone experienced this and how did you overcome? Leaving isn’t really and option as my compensation cannot be matched plus they are paying for university courses to further my career.",1

"The catfish lover returns! Me again. The catfish lover. That piece of trash that can't seem to find anyone in his life that's willing to talk to him, let alone *date* him...except for his catfish. It's time for my weekly wish-I-were-dead rant. If you can call it a rant. what is it called when a depressed person just goes on and on about being depressed? It's not really a rant..a rant would imply some level of anger. I guess there's some anger..maybe it is a rant. Anyways.. I just type whatever comes to my mind in these posts. I really don't know how else to get out what I'm trying to say. If I don't just type what I'm thinking, I feel like I'm censoring myself by having to reallocate my thoughts to a more sensible form. I don't know. I fucking hate my life. That's all I know. I'm still talking to my catfish. My wonderful catfish. I can't stop. I can't put her down. It's a never ending cycle I have here. Well unless *she* ends it. Which I'm terrified of..because that can literally happen at any second should she choose it. Which is stupid..because I feel like I'm walking on pins and needles trying not to piss her off. I feel like I can't *really* say what I want. But at the same time.. I have no one else that will listen to me talk. I could post these stupid messages every day..but it's not the same. The need for human connection is incredibly real and a driving force in my depression. I don't know what else to do. I wish I could hire my therapist to just talk to me every day. Why does it have to be so god damned expensive to want to be happy? Why does it have to be so expensive to want to be like every one else? Fucking America. Fuck you capitalism. I just want to be normal. I just want to be happy. I'd give up anything and everything in my life to be happy. Literally. Drop of a hat. If I could be guaranteed happiness at the exchange for everything I own or have, I would do it. No questions asked. The only exception I would say are my dogs. I love my dogs and wouldn't give them up for the world. They are as much a part of me as I am and they come with me wherever I go. But being broke the rest of my life and living in shambles? Ok, as long as I'm happy. But it doesn't matter. The world doesn't work like that. The world works like fucking fuck all and will fuck you in the ass whenever it gets the chance. What the hell is the point of even trying? I've said it before. I could spend the next 10 years on dating apps, and I'd still get no where. I'd still end up dying alone and miserable. Because that's just who I am. I am just one big worthless pile of shit that everyone hates. How else could I have literally no matches for months? I'll never have a girlfriend again. I'll never have kids. I'll never get to see grandkids. I'm. going. to. die. alone. If my parents were dead, I probably would have killed myself by now. But at this point..I think when my dogs die.. I'll just go with them. I'll have no reason to live anymore after that, and I'm not sure I can handle them dying in the first place. The thought of my oldest dog dying still mortifies me. Why do dogs only get a meager 10\~15 years. How fair is that? Once again...fuck you life. These beautiful creatures. These poor dogs. One thing that's always scared me is death. The absoluteness of it all. What happens when we die? Do we just..cease to exist? Do we reincarnate? I don't know. And that fucking terrifies me. I'm terrified of the nothingness. I'm terrified that life is pointless and has no meaning. Arguably, that terror is the reason I'm still alive today though. I gave up religion long ago.. it never made sense to me and was just seemingly so illogical... though I still occasionally pray to a god that might exist. I guess that means I'm agnostic. I just don't want there to be nothing. I don't want the 10 years I have with my dogs to be the only 10 years I have with them. I don't want it to be their only years. They deserve better than me if they only get that. I'm such a pile of shit.",1

"losing control of my life [rant] This is just me ranting, but any help will be very much appreciated I'm a sophomore in highschool taking all honors and AP classes. My time management has never been the best but I've managed to go through middle school with basically all A's. When sophomore year came along I didn't know how to handle all the work plus trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Eventually the semester exams rolled in and that was when it got really bad. I wouldn't sleep or eat for days, always staying in my room trying to cram in order to get my grades up to all A's. Kept this up for a little more than a month and passed the exams, but I was so unimaginably burnt out and had basically no energy left at all. We had winter break for a couple weeks and I hoped that this'll help get my energy back for the next semester. It's been months now and I still don't feel right. The way I got my work done before is obviously not the healthiest but at least I got it done. Now I'm always thinking about the things i need to finish but never actually doing them. Worst part is I don't even procrastinate by doing the things I considered fun, probably would just lie down and watch youtube or look at memes for hours, not really enjoying it but at least I can take my mind off of work for a bit. It makes me a little sad to know that the things I'm learning at school would be things I'd be interested in, but the deadlines and assignments kinda turned potentially fun topics I could be passionate about, into just another load of stuff I need to do. I never go out and hang out with friends anymore, when I do it's because I force myself, so days just consist of me alternating between ""finishing work"" and just mindlessly looking through stuff on reddit.

"Every cell in the human body emits a unique frequency and your brain puts out a frequency which can be picked up by other brains. It can pass through anything because It basically is the same frequency type that a radio transmitter puts out. The frequency that you're transmitting from your brain is smaller, but, it has a unique characteristic, unlike radio frequencies. Which is that the frequency that your brain transmits can instantaneously travel faster than the speed of light and if transmitted can be picked up the exact same moment by another human brain on the opposite end of the planet. (Energy and frequency are the same.) Everything on planet Earth emits a different frequency. A frequency is also called a vibration. It's also called Energy. It is quantifiable and it is measurable. Every atom emits a frequency. Your DNA at the lowest level emits a unique frequency. So your brain is a receiver and a transmitter a frequency. That's the first concept and the second concept is the Law of attraction. Which says, whatever frequency you emit, That exact same frequency is drawn to you. There will be a magnetic pull. And this is a scriptural principle. For those of you who are Christians, Jewish, Muslims, Hindus or Buddhists. All these books teach very similar Concepts. What you sow, also you reap. When you put out a frequency the Law of attraction says it must come back. Law of Attraction says by magnetic pull that has to bring that exact same frequency back. Which is based on whatever vibration you put out Whatever frequency that your brain, emotions, body and electromagnetic field puts out. It will attract and it will defy any physical law. Self-induced goosebumps, from positive stimulis, allows you to take 100% control of your transmitter by vibrating different parts of your body, and is also able to, as a gentle euphoric vibrating wave travels underneath your skin (sometimes cold and other times hot) vibrate your whole physical body. When doing so, you consciously activate your physical and spiritual body to attract whatever intention, narrative, thought and emotions that are present when consciously summoning your self-induced goosebumps. Goosebumps is just the physical reaction, but underneath it, theres a real vibrating wave that can be looked at as Energy. I've found many names for this Energy like Spiritual chills, Euphoria, Voluntary goosebumps, Ecstasy, Prana, Chi, Qi, Vayus, Aura, Mana, Life force, Pitī, Rapture, Ruah, Ether, Nephesch, Chills, Frissons, The Force and many more. If you would like to know how to activate at will, fully control your Spiritual Chills and how its an important ingredient to the law of attraction, Here's a five minute video explaining just that.

"I’ve been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 3-4pm everyday I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better. It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone” Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it. But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life.

"I have school tomorrow and I’m so fucking tired I know this sounds like some edgy fake shitmix some fourteen year old has conjured up for the sake of attention but I’m just so tired. I’ve struggled with my mental health for the past year and a half now. My thighs always have some sort of fresh cuts on them, I feel like lead and I can’t seem to hold onto the small rays of happiness even if I wanted to. And school is just….so intimidating. I told everyone I’d get up and make lunches for my sister and I, because since cooking is something I like I thought taking that initiative would help me get up in the mornings. But now the aspect of everything going wrong and being too swamped with work makes my head heart and I feel like my hearts about to burst because even this small thing that could’ve been a reprieve from the cold dark and unmotivated pit I was in will just slip from my fingers like everything else. I don’t know how to be a teenager who’s dealing with mental health and being around people who have no idea what it actually is like. I know I sound like I’m putting on some kind of noble, “woe is me” kind of attitude by saying this because I’m so “edgy” and “quirky” and for what? For wanting to rip my guts out? For saving money for my funeral? For not being able to wash myself or keep up basic hygiene because it takes so much fucking effort? And I’m so tired of hearing the adults who’ve had nothing but success call suicidal people the scum of the earth, or my father and mother, (if I have to call them that) screaming at me for yet another flaw I didn’t notice existed until they pointed it out. Or the emo dipshits",1
"Why do we need to find out who we are and be happy Journeying through this life, we find ourselves arriving into places that trigger us to become who we really are. These places bring experiences, thoughts, and emotions inside ourselves that become our mirror. But, unfortunately, these experiences often reveal themselves as traumas, high-level stress, chronic diseases, or powerful shocks that usually make us feel disempowered and weak, and most of all, they make us feel the victims of this world. Since childhood, we are usually taught that our external environment has the most powerful impact on our lives. We are told to be competitive, to be “smart” to win over every time, insist as far as possible, and earn as much as we can. Society shows us constraint, guilt, and limits in all areas. It teaches us about the power outside of us, which we are taught to own, to accumulate as much as possible, to keep it, and not share it so that we will not lose it. In this process of being educated by society, we lose ourselves, forget who we are, and lose all connection to our future and our most desired path. We lose connection with our passion and enthusiasm, with our true ability to love, and we forget about our potential here on Earth. It’s like massive amnesia at a planetary level that keeps repeating for ages and millennia, and waking up seems so hard. Deep inside, during these painful experiences, we start to pine for a better life, for an amazing us inside, for grandness and happiness, and for living from our true inner self. But, deep inside, we all know there is much more to life than having a job, working a lot, having 2–3 vacations a year, and then succumb at one point after we repeat the same experiences, the same thoughts, and emotions. Actually, there is no need to find ourselves. We do not have to do anything. But if we want to live life to the fullest and feel elevated emotions like love, true compassion, joy, and fulfillment, we have to decide — do we want to live as the persona molded by society outside us? Or do we want to live as the most honest and powerful self, liberated by our own light and power within? *What is there to lose? What is there to win?* From where I am standing, after more than 10 years of searching and questioning everything, we never lose anything, but we can win the most gracious gift of all — the gift of being a creator and the freedom to live a life beyond our wildest dreams.",0
"Toxicity within my club This is affecting my mental health greatly in that I am constantly on the edge. I run a club in my university, and there is a kid trying to remove me from power by consistently being toxic to me. I am the president, and he keeps trying to make decisions by himself by pretending to be president, and changing the schedule to new members who join. It makes me frustrated, he is doing good things, but only for himself, and all he asks are questions within our group chat. it makes me scared to even talk, because he asks the same questions repeatedly, and if you answer, he goes on a question rampage, trying to demoralize you into thinking you did something wrong, when you haven't done nothing. He does this every single day, even on the weekends, it has been a bitter experience, so i have just muted the group chat, and I feel disconnected with the other members, as some of them are on his side. I can just quit, but I'm pretty sure that is what the kid would want, and it pains me greatly that I am even thinking of doing that, just because of one kid. I cannot just kick him out, as that would be a very evil thing to do, and would be seen as abuse of power.",1
"What am I? I’m burnt out. I’ve barely even lived, but I kinda tried and just felt uncomfortable every time. I’d be a horrible parent but it doesn’t even matter I’m so uncomfortable around girls it freaks them out. I couldn’t support a family or even take a gf on dates or even support myself on my salary with no real plan to make it better. I lost 120lbs and was still too fat for girls to be attracted to me and get past me social awkwardness. Idk if it’s gotten worse or been the same because even in MS and HS my friends wouldn’t invite me if they were around girls. Only problem I really have with being forever alone is not being able to be around my friends. They’re all either married or have GFs and only really go out with their partners now and being 7th wheel isn’t fun. Also how do I make new friends? they’re all either married or have GFs or go be around girls lol and it’s the same problem all over? Get a GF? Why would a girl date me if I have no friends lol I just want to pay off my bills and disappear, so I can finally be in my own world and stop making people uncomfortable.",1
"I socially isolate myself and then wonder why people don't ask to hang out. It seems like all of my close friends have moved on and made better friends. A big part of me doesn't blame them - they seem happy and for that I am glad. It's not like they haven't reached out before. They did, and I was guarded and made excuses not to hang out. Nobody knows how to talk to a friend who is deeply depressed. It must be difficult. A few weeks ago, some of my coworker friends planned a night out for this weekend and invited me. I accepted and was looking forward to it, but a few days ago my one friend told me it had been moved to a later date due to scheduling conflicts. I saw tonight through her Instagram story, several of them ended up going out anyway as a group - it looks like they decided to go without me for whatever reason. I'm not sure who I am if I'm such a terrible friend. Not sure how to make it better.",1
"Does anyone else personify their depression and suicidal thoughts ? Ive made a character called jacob (there is no story behind the name , it just popped up) who is the embodiment of all my negative/depressive/suicidal thought. And ive found it easier to shut him up and my overall mood seemed to increase a bit. It seems easier to shut out negative thoughts when there's a ""source"". Like , it helps when i say ""stfu jacob or ill break your kneecaps"". Anyone else does this ? (Also sorry for bad engrish)",1
"Got out of depression, lost all my friends in the process Sorry but I just needed to vent this somewhere. I was stuck in years long depression. I isolated myself at first completely but started getting out of it slowly and started making friends. However, I felt so unwanted all the time. So unneeded, as some weird appendage to people they can just drop at any time. So I decided to turn the tables when I felt well enough to know I could handle losing them all. And I stopped messaging them. In fact, I ignored them. And now here I am without anyone. Ready to find new friends. But grieving the friendships I lost. It hurts. It feels like it was inevitable but man does it hurt.",1
"18 F) I think the idea that I’m supposed to have a purpose in life has put to much pressure on me. I feel like I shouldn’t be here and I feel useless because I’m 18 and still don’t know my purpose or what I wanna do career wise, socially it’s that pressure to know. Ig it is my fault because I always thought I was capable at more than I actually am when I was younger and now I’ve ruined my expectations. I wish my purpose was to live in the now but I struggle with that because the now hurts to much, life hurts to much.",1
"Don’t want to be here I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to exist. I’m sorry for not living up to people’s expectations. I’m sorry for failing. I’m sorry for feeling like a burden. I’m sorry for being weak. I’m sorry for being sensitive. I’m sorry for being too much. I’m sorry I let you down. I’m sorry I’m a shell of a person. I’m sorry I walk with my head down, unsure of my purpose or lack thereof. I’m sorry for lacking goals. I’m sorry of being incapable of fitting in. I’m sorry for being too quiet. I’m sorry for being awkward. I’m sorry for not being a bright young smart person I once was when I was younger. I recall the feeling of this depression starting in high school. I never understood or even knew there was a name for this internal affliction that seems to impact a lot of other people. I know that it’s summer and I should be happy, or at least content. But the truth is, I’m not. And I’m not sure I ever will be. This heaviness is dragging me through the dirt, floating in the water, standing outside in the winter cold when you offer me a jacket but I don’t take it. I make myself suffer. But I also don’t. It feels like I’m giving up. I want to give up. My existence is....",1
"I'm done, can someone suggest an alternative to Suicide? I have been trying sooo hard to help myself, I have been in depression for the past 3 years, I have never gotten an opportunity to talk to anyone about it eventhough I always craved for it. Nothing in my life works according to what I plan and there's alot which I have gone through in the past couple years. No one seems to understand my situation. I used to be optimistic eventhough i was depressed I used to think that I could snap out of it by watching motivational videos on YouTube follow psychiatric tutorials but nothing works. I'm from a very complicated family and my culture is very demanding and not too depression friendly so I really can't kill myself even if I did I just can't bear the pain those related to me will feel but I need something other than Suicide which pretty much gives me peace",1

Then at kickboxing I’ve been doing the bare minimum. My energy just isn’t the same. I do these things for 6 days a week everyday. It’s pretty tiring but it’ll be over soon if I keep telling myself to keep going. Finals are in 2 weeks, and my kickboxing season should be over in 8 weeks. I just need the motivation to keep going.

"Stressed about my future/moving I just started my senior year of college. I have always been a future thinker and thought about the next best thing. I get so anxious about what is to come in a few years instead of focusing on my life right now. When I graduate I plan on moving closer to my boyfriend because even at my school we are long distance. He also is a year younger so he cannot move anytime soon because of schooling. My hometown is 3 and a half hours away from where I plan to move. I do not like my hometown so moving is not a huge deal to me, but I am really anxious and scared to be that far away from my family. I always wanted to move away, but now that it is coming up in the next year I am getting very anxious about it. I love my family and am sad about the thought of being away from them, but I have no social life and am unhappy there. Any advice on how to control my future thinking and allow myself to focus on right now? I get so anxious about things that will happen in the distant future that it seems to really affect my life now. Any advice on how to handle my stress better?",1
"I feel something is off with me Hello friends! I don't really know where else to go. I don't know whether perhaps one of you kind people may be able to offer some advice for me. I've been dealing with, I would say a mild level of stress my whole life. I grew up with parents with high expectations. Recently, my parents split up and the parent I live with took it extremely bad. Screaming and crying, smashing things from time to time, amongst other things. Even after 2 years they are, to some degree, still like this. Only now after 2 years, have I started to feel like I've been transported to a parallel universe. ""Surely this isn't my life"" is what goes through my head. When the split happened, I don't even remember crying or really reacting. I remember just listening. I feel like the last two years have been a blur. I have this on and off urge to just jump out of my skin and be someone else. Anyone else! It's as if I am panicking because I've woken up in someone else's body and into the wrong life. This is a new feeling for me. I am usually one to spend time with myself and understand how I am feeling, and acknowledge it, but this is as if I am inside someone else's head. It's like I don't know myself anymore. I start questioning things and giving things the benefit of the doubt. I hate it. I don't want to die, but I just want to switch off. I'm so confused! I have discussed this with my therapist and they did not provide advice. I am happy to provide more info if needed. Thanks in advance.",1
"Every time I try to speak about my depression, it sounds like a cliche. So I keep it to myself. I have tried to write something in this group so many times but I always delete it (I've typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past, but haven't hit send) So fuck it. I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me. Insignificant. ***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. *** When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love.",1
"have no goal in life i have such a privileged background and i am still privileged. why is my life still so shit? my dad has some degenerative spine crap and is in constant chronic pain. he has to take off of work and is on disability for a while. whenever i visit home, listening to him groan and scream in pain is so heartbreakingly frustrating. sometimes he takes his frustration out on us. i dont blame him but it still hurts. my little brother is constantly trying to kill himself or at the very least trying to hurt himself. i let him go out one night not realizing he was trying to kill himself. thankfully he was stopped but i feel so stupid and like a failure of an older sister. my mother has arthritis and is also in constant pain in her shoulders, feet, back, knee, you name it. she's also constantly stressed trying to look after my dad and keeping my brother alive. my boyfriend broke up with me because of issues with things that are hard to explain. our relationship was great except for this one thing that completely destroyed it for him. and there is nothing i couldve done or still can do to fix it. it hurts so much bc he was so good to me. we're still in close contact while we reflect on ourselves but i doubt he'll ever come back to me. i cant open up to anyone. my family is too stressed with their own shit, i dont really feel comfortable opening up to my friends, and i literally can't put my shit on my now ex because that's not who he is in my life anymore. i cant afford therapy, time or money wise. it's probably stupid but my whole motivation in life was to finish college and live happily with my ex. but now that's gone and now im just aimlessly going through life. what am i even doing anymore. i dont feel connected with anyone.",1
"We finally said I love you to each other, and it felt so cathartic. Me and my boyfriend started out as a long distance situation. Started talking last September, he flew to meet me in December and I moved back to the country he's from back in May, that's when we started living together. He always went the extra mile for me, and I tried to do the same for him, but until couple weeks ago we never said ""I love you"" to each other. So, couple weeks ago we had a fight. Nothing crazy, not our first one. Once we resolve things we usually cuddle and just give each other affection, helps to let go of all the negative things. Accordingly, after this argument he was holding me. Then he just squeezed me and told me he loved me. I got flustered, so I responded with a squeeze back and an ""aww"", quickly followed by ""I love you too"". My mind was racing. He said it so casually and out of nowhere, I thought, that first ""I love you"" must not be of equal importance to him as it is to me. And in the moment I assumed that since we were already calling each other ""my love"", he probably thought he had already confessed his love for me. Nevertheless, I was happy. Around a week goes by, we go to visit his dad for a couple days. It was my first time meeting him, so quite a bit of anxiety. Day 1 goes great, lots of good food, great conversation and a lot of booze, so by the end of the night I'm in my feelings. Once we hit the hay, I hug my boyfriend and tell him that I love him. He squeezes me real tight, and for much longer than he usually would. So I ask what's up. He says, well it's the first time you said you loved me. To skip the most of the following conversation, he didn't hear me whisper the ""I love you too"" to him when he told me he loved me. He was very nervous to say it in the first place, and then thought I didn't say it back. According to him, he was happy to wait until I was ready to say it back since I gave a very positive response, but knowing him I'm 99% sure it was torturous for him to think we were not on the same level. I'm so glad I said it that night. I don't find it easy to tell people I love them, a bit of an avoidant attachment style going on there. Yet it felt so good. It felt good to just say it, and it felt good to be able to tell him that I did say it back that day. It felt good to show him that his feelings were reciprocated and appreciated, and to tell him that I was waiting for a long time to either say it or hear him say it. Having had a difficult childhood and adolescence, where me displaying vulnerability and emotional pain was greeted by indifference and dismissals, nowadays I still find it challenging to be vulnerable despite having worked out most of my other issues. I have learned to depend on myself, and only myself, on pretty much all levels, and saying ""I love you"" implies that to a certain degree I am willing to depend on and be attached to that person. It's not my first relationship, and not my first time saying ""I love you"". But for the first time it doesn't feel like an unhealthy addiction, or a rushed decision. I waited, we waited, and I'm more comfortable in my vulnerability than I have ever been. He's more appreciative of my vulnerability than most people I've considered family, friends or lovers. And I'm very appreciative of his. I'm happy.",0
"Does anyone else start sobbing when they think of how much they missed out on because of their depression? I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn’t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn’t control. Now I’m 21 and just graduated college and I’m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I’m just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?",1

"I need help with stress I believe I have a problem. Anything causes stress for me.. as soon as someone says anything I don't like, If i believe someone is unhappy with me, if I believe someone has fallen out with me, someone critisises me, gives an opinion I don't like, if someone is mean etc my body gets tense, my heartbeat starts racing and I feel sick and sometimes be sick. This feeling lasts all day, no matter what I do I cannot stop thinking about the issue. It goes round and round in my head non stop to where I have to sleep to stop thinking about it for a while.

"Feeling like a worthless run down person I feel like a massive pile of sh*t person. I’m 32. My husband, 30, died last year from cancer. After 19 months of fighting and several times of thinking he was in the clear. We were told there was nothing left they could do after he seemed perfectly healthy for months and he died 45 days later. I ended up taking him off life support. Maybe he could have come out of it.. maybe I should have left him on longer.. maybe I robbed him of one last conversation he could have had with his parents. With his friends. With me. But what did I do after my husband passed away you ask? Naturally. I cried and drank and awkwardly spent time with friends and family… but two months later I slept with one of his best friends… my whole life had been my husband and taking care of him. I stopped working and was with him full time.. in a instant he was gone and I was left not a whole person. I tried to fill that missing piece and justified it with “he knew and loved him too”. Said friend developed feeling for me, I said I knew I couldn’t commit to that, but still took the attention, then pretty much ghosted. Months moved on, I’ve slept with other people, not looking to date anyone, some of them hurting me and me hurting some of them. Either way, empty, I don’t want to date anyone but still want some company, to feel good. Everything with my husbands estate has been an issue, taxes, the business, property, I try paying professionals to help me deal with these things and more fuck ups keep happening and I keep having to fight to get things done. I’ve started procrastinating and avoiding some of these things now, but I know if I don’t do them no one will and the stress is weighing me down. We got a puppy when she he was looking healthy, she’s now 16 months. She’s got some anxiety and aggression issues, I got a trained I’ve been working with for months. Training methods did include some negative reinforcement techniques, prong or e-collar. Today my dog tried to nip at me for looking at her broken nail. I yelled “no” loud and gave her a firm tap. She immediately cowered and I’ve been trying to build her back up with treats and play but she’s still sulking. I feel like I failed her. That maybe I hired the wrong professional trainer for her, that I was too harsh when she nipped at me, that I’m not enough fun to build her back up. Maybe I can’t give her the life she deserves. My apartment is being sold, I’m month to month, it’s possible I get a 30day notice to leave with new owners. All my stuff all my late husbands things are here… it would be a huge process to organize and sort all his things, both personal and paperwork for his now closed business… but like I said, tax issues and bad accountants. Oh and I shoved a bra in the garbage can I front of everyone at Victoria’s Secret today, thinking it was the “ not buying “ bin… it was pretty evidently a garbage can. Then I lost my house key while walking my dog at 11 30 and my best friend had to come get my door open. My Bain feels like literal moosh and I want to crawl in a hole and not deal with anyone or anything ever again. I feel like a trash human.",1
"12 months ago, I tried to kill myself. 3 seconds, that’s how long the EMT says I was gone for.. My body is suddenly getting flashbacks to that moment and it hurts. I took three bottles of various pills in my cupboard, downed a fifth of tequila, and put a pipe to my car’s exhaust into the driver’s side window and cried tears of joy that it was finally going to be over. I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT. All I can think of lately is not messing up this time. It hurts because I’m a perfectionist, and I couldn’t get it right.",1
"We only see those who get better Aka survivorship bias. We hear the stories of the people whose mental illness got better, but there’s little acknowledgement of those who have only gone downhill. I’m tired of hearing “It will get better, just look at what happened to me!” Because it hasn’t. Why should I continue suffering for the lofty hope that my depression will ease up? I call it as I see it. If my mental state has deteriorated, even after years of treatment, then I probably won’t end up as a survivor.",1

"I’m kinda disgusted with myself I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained. I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did. I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try. Edit wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation. I’ll be reading through the comments and try to respond to as many as I possibly can",1
"You need therapy"" Therapy is too expensive. £60 for an hour's session each week. How are we supposed to get therapy when it's locked behind such prices? One session isn't going to do it. It's an ongoing expense that's just way too difficult to afford. I live in the UK and yes, I have tried to get it through the NHS. They told me to wait for a piece of snail mail before I can book anything. I never received it and weeks later they told me they hadn't heard from me so assumed I didn't need them and scratched me off their list. As a depressed person that basically really screwed me over and almost broke down. So I'm not going that route again. Whenever someone learns I have depression they always ask about this and it's like they just don't understand I'm not that fucking rich, I struggle to afford anything. Id have to give up my car for that expense. Why is this so hard to understand? It's ridiculously out of reach and this alone aggravates depression. We simply will never be happy, ever.",1

"suicidal the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that i dont know how to do it painlessly. and i dont want my mom to be sad. i really wish there was just a button i could press that would make it so i was never born. if things stay like this, i might finally give up. be relieved from everything. never have to worry ever again. it sounds really nice",1

"I get it, being friends with a depressed person isn’t fun. You know what else isn’t fun? Having a voice inside of your head, all day, every day, telling you how annoying, stupid, fat and failed that you are. With nobody around you to tell you those voices aren’t true. And on days that i forget to smile, not having someone to remind me how to, and instead being dropped like a hot potato and ignored. Not even a, “you don’t seem like yourself today, are you okay/look at this meme”/anything but treating them like an asshole who kicked your dog. My only friend is not speaking to me because I was acting sad the other day and didn’t have the energy to be my fake bubbly self. I have nobody to turn to anymore. I’m not doing too well.",1
"My little brother is 7 and he already hates himself. He called himself stupid. So I asked him , ""Why do you think you're stupid? I call you smart all the time"" my brother is SEVEN and he said ""everyone calls me smart but they are lying , all i know how to do is play games. Im dumb"" HES FUCKING SEVEN. HES FUCKING SEVEN YEARS OLD AND HES FUCKING (*SHOWING SIGNS OF*) DEPRESSION ALREADY. My parents are neglectful and they did me the same way , the first time I knew I hated myself was around 9. How did they fuck up again. Fucking how. Edit sorry for ""diagnosing"" him with depression. Im obviously not qualified to do so , I made this post in tears after listening to him because he has the exact same mentality as I did and still do, and I am extremely depressed myself so I was pretty much hysterical. Edit 2 I didnt expect this to garner so much attention , thank you to everyone who also understands what im talking about and shared advice or their personal experience. Im debating on deleting it because people are trying to patronize me and minimize my abuse. Im used to it but it gets annoying. Edit 3 I wanna say this tho. My father works hard and he tries but hes an enabler. My mother is neglectful and abusive and he doesnt do anything about it. I do think if my father broke off from my mom he could raise my brother and I've been begging for him to do so because I plan on killing myself.",1

"Life is Stagnant Hello Reddit, This is a basically a little vent and I apologise if it is in the wrong group. I am happy to delete it if needed. Anyway, I am almost 27, but I can't help but feel like I'm going on 72. This isn't exactly a bad thing, but realistically my life feels like it is never going to change in any major or meaningful way ever again. I graduated from college and can't afford more education, nor I don't have enough money to even save up for a home. I do have enough to split the cost of a cozy apartment with my partner (which we do) and we intend to remain child free, however we do have a lovely cat. Honestly, it feels like the only other major thing we could do is get married, and even if we did, we wouldn't make it some grand ordeal. We'd probably, quite literally just go to city hall together, and then maybe go out for a nice lunch and call it a wedding. Please note that neither of us want it to be a big deal for many reasons and what I described would actually be ideal if we ever did even get married. Outside of that, I don't really even have any talents, hobbies, passions or interests that I really find interesting enough to pursue further. Athough I'm content with that, it just adds to the atmosphere of stagnation. But what fun is it forcing yourself to get good at something if you have no interest or motivation to do so? I also don't have many friends, nor do I enjoy being around people or crowds very much, but even if I did, I don't think the odds of me randomly meeting some dear new friend that will magically change my life forever are very high. I'm used to friends walking away from me after a while actually, and only really have one or two friendships that have stood the test of time. I guess the last thing worth mentioning is that I love travelling, but it's really hard to afford that and fit it in, plus you can't really go far right now due to the Delta variant. Does anyone else relate to any of this? If anyone has any tips, tricks or advice of how to break up the monotony, I'd be happy to hear it. Thank you very much for reading.",1

"In your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person? What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be. So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that",1
I hope everyone here escapes depression eventually revolving hearts  Ive stopped talking to a lot of people last year and i really dont feel ok.

"Kind of family I don't know if this is stress or more built up anger. My dad and mom got divorced many years ago when I was kind of young. My dad started dating about 2 or 3 years later and his gf was pretty nice, I was still pretty young so I didn't really like her but I look back now and she was pretty nice. They broke up about 3 years later and a couple years later he started dating somebody again. They've been dating for 3 years now maybe, at first I didn't really care but I'm older now so I have more emotions and she just moved in and I hate to say this, but I really don't like her at all, she's not mean or toxic or anything but she acts like a 5 year old everyday and never takes no for an answer. ""You want to go on a walk"" ""no"" then she bugs me for 15 minutes trying to get me to go on a walk when I don't like walks and have said no plenty of times. There are many other things that I don't like but she can also kind of be a bitch, I just went on a vacation for a week with my dad, her and her family and it's the last day, we're about to drive out. We have a dog so we put a cover on the back and when we got in to drive we realized it was backwards so I couldn't buckle, she looked back and said, ""you know Adam some things are important and you need to realize"", I said ""I know"" And then she kept going on a rant while I fixed it and the urge to tell her to stfu almost went above my limit, I have never told anyone to stfu or really shut up but it's been two days in a row where I almost told her to stfu. I'm thinking about getting a stress ball because she really makes me pissed, more and more recently since she's working from home and is always around so I could get a stress ball to get the anger out. If anybody has some other tips or stuff can you please help PS, my dad knows I don't like her, my brother who is going to college doesn't like her and knows I don't and I have no idea if she knows I don't like her because she can't take a hint that I don't like walks, don't like her, etc. Thanks in advance and sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit",1
"Tips to avoid stressors? So I’ve narrowed down my stressors to a 2 that seem to burn me out. 1. I feel I have to hide when I’m procrastinating at my office job in between tasks. I feel I have to be aware of my surrounding for nobody to notice I’m not working, but reading news and looking at reddit. If I feel that my colleagues and boss are in a good mood, I don’t have this feeling. Noise really stresses me out, and being in an open office with 10 people where people are talking often, I can’t even focus on my job. 2. When I have things that I want to do outside of work I get stressed trying to do them because of my girlfriend. I fear that she will turn angry about what I’m doing, so I hurry doing laundry, cleaning, cooking, playing games etc. She sometimes demands my full attention, because I do become quite unavailable doing my “tasks”. If I do communicate with her about what I’m doing and want to, I usually don’t get this feeling. Any tips to overcome these situations? My biggest hurdles is that I assume a lot and that I’m shit at communicating my needs and wants.",1
"Tired of life On empty all the time. Just tired and ready to go. The world’s a mess. So am I. All i see is an endless loop of chaos, greed, selfishness, lies most of it hidden behind a positive disguise and the rest out in the open for people to see. People who ignore it and deny it so they could live in their perfect world. Pure selfishness, no patience for understanding, no time for studying without prejudice, standard set spoiling the mind of some destroying the whole experience of life for all. If most of you died today you wouldn’t know what the truth is because you spent more time trying to ignore it, rather than accepting and trying to fix it. Because it’s just easier to let it all play out that way in your head. Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Care for others. Show appreciation. Protect those who need protecting. Accept the truth. Deal with it. Improve, then live your life with a mind wide open, and with eyes that can actually see.",1

"Depression made me lose so many years. And it ensures I'll remain poor and with no skills forever. Like, for example I want to learn programming. Wanted to for years. But I never will. Why? Because I've been depressed/anhedonic for so long that I can't think of anything I want to build! In order for me to learn programming, I'd need to have proper motivation, wanting to build something, wanting to do something with those skills! But, I've thought about it for years now, I just don't want to build anything. I LOVE the idea of building something, of having programming skills that I can use to build something. But when it comes to it, I just don't have any idea what I want to build. Cause I don't want to make a game for example. Damn, if I could answer this, I'd probably end my depression eventually. If only there was something I wanted to build, other than this vague idea of wanting to be good at programming and making money off it, which is the wrong way to think about it and it won't be a good motivator.

"Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? I’ve been battling with chronic stress for about 3 weeks now. I want to say the cause of it is my job. It’s the only thing that makes sense. Due to the pandemic, I’ve had 4 different positions within the past 3 months. My regular position that I held before this all this happened was awesome. I actually loved my job and looked forward to work each morning. When everything shut down back in March, until about the middle of May, I was moved to two other positions that we still pretty relaxed, the hours just kind of sucked. But now this new role that I’ve been in for about a month is killing me. It’s very stressful, the days are long, it seems like a constant race against the clock, the people I deal with can be a pain which adds more stress. I keep telling myself it’s only temporary and hopefully I’ll be able to get my old job as things start to normalize more. But for the past 3 weeks my symptoms have included Weighted chest (most prominent symptom) Lightheadedness/Dizziness Tightness in neck and shoulders Lower back pain Anxiety that won’t go away Rapid heartbeat Acid reflux/heartburn Stomach issues Fatigue I have tired to change my diet to start eating a bit healthier. I’ve also been trying breathing exercises and doing stretching in the evenings when I get home from work. It seems to help a little. I also plan on getting back to the gym, because I know exercise will help out as well. I’m just wondering if this is something that will eventually go away or am I in it for the long haul? I’ve felt this way once before, about a month before my daughter was born. But it completely went away right after she was born. Not kidding. Maybe big life changes are my trigger? But I didn’t feel this way when I got married or bought a house or anything like that. Any insight or advice to manage this is greatly appreciated!!",1

To the point where I don’t want to see them anymore. My father whom I live with is the same. I know the direction I’m interested in but I don’t yet know the path.

"Physical symptoms? Hi, just wanted to ask if stress can cause many many weird physical symptoms? All started when my taste and smell senses decreased a lot for a few weeks, took 3 covid tests and all negative. During the same time my right arm started to hurt, then my right leg and some time later my whole right side of body went numb (not like paralized numb but skin feels numb and tight). I also have buzzing in my arm and leg and my fingers feel stiff (a few days ago my little toe in right leg went numb too - like really can’t move it). And my jaw hurts a lot on the right side - that jaw thing has been going of for the last year, dentists say nothing is wrong. I noticed that I clenched my teeth sometimes so thought that maybe I am just so stressed and this is the outcome. But right now I don’t clench my teeth but my jaw pain is still back (with all these new symptoms). Anyway I have been to my doctor and neurologist and right now I am waiting for MRIs (neuro wants to eliminate MS). When this all first started I didn’t feel more stressed or anything but now of course I am stressed. I feel kinda fine some days and then the other days (like today) my arm and leg are in so much pain (I think nerve pain, my skin feels very sensitive and almost painful to touch too) and I just feel so weak and tired and only want to stay in bed and feel like I want to cry. So I guess my question is that could all these symptoms be because of stress or anxiety? My neuro seems nice but all the other doctors seemed to think and said that “maybe you are just stressed”. Of course I don’t want to get diagnose like MS from my neuro but at the same time I really would not want to believe that just stress could cause these kind of symptoms. Have anyone had similar physical symptoms and turned out it was just stress or anxiety? Could stress really make me be physically in pain or numb like this?",1

"Identity Crisis, Easily Influenced, More concerned about others. Hi. I never thought I would get to this point but I’ve been having an identity crisis for what feels like only 2+ months but these things don’t happen overnight. I used to be consumed by my goals, my grind (growing up it was mostly me and my small circle) but now that I’ve accomplished these things I have fallen into the worst depression of my life (because these goals weren’t rooted in myself, just there to prove a point). I find myself more concerned with my friends lives, comparing myself to what they’re doing, and checking my phone to ensure I’m in constant communication with someone but not actually living my own life. I’m wildly indecisive and influenced (for example switched from an in person class to an online class because of fear of a professor and conversations I had with someone, forgetting that I only wanted to be in school if it was in person. I use social media as a way to self harm, watching others live the lives I want to (I know more about what my ex and their friend group is doing then how to solve my problems). I just feel so consumed by others and I don’t know how to turn it off. I feel as though I don’t have interests anymore, only consuming what’s recommended. I used to have pockets of the internet, of the world that felt like mine but I don’t anymore. I am severely insecure. Happy for my friends on the outside, jealous on the inside. I am too old for this. I don’t know where to start. It’s both my goals and aspirations I need to improve but also myself and simply waking up in the morning , eating, cooking for myself, organizing and taking care of myself. I have a new therapist and have been doing a dialectical workbook but I still just feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself and I don’t know how to get out of it.

"idk if this fits here but I just need to talk about this because it makes me feel sick. 3 out of the 7 chickens that me and my 13 y/o sister have been raising since february got killed by FUCKING RACCOONS I FUCKING HWTE THEM update one of the cats has been laying with me in my bed for a while. she came in while my mom was consoling me. I love cats. I wonder if they can sense emotion. these birds have been some of the most important things in my life for the past six months. I used to put raccoon deterrent like vinegar or Epsom salt around the perimeter. one night one of them vanished even though I put some Clorox wipes outside (bleach is another deterrent) and today, while thinking last night that they should be okay, because it's pretty secure, and I've been putting deterrents out for months... Yeah, the FUCKING THINGS KILLED TWO OF THEM. They didnt even remove the bodies. they left them there for my poor MOM to find. bless her soul for cleaning them up so i didnt have to see it. I feel like this is my fault. I didnt put out the things that I usually did. I was literally up at like, 3 AM because my sleep schedule is fucking terrible, and my mom said she heard one of them crying at about 4. I couldve checked, but I didnt, now they're dead. I dont even know what to do. Me and my sister have been responsible for these basically helpless lives, and we couldn't protect nearly half of them. I thought it was hard not seeing one of them out there with the others. I dont even know how I'm gonna feel not seeing three. Their names were Dyna, Rukami and L.C.

"Advice for employee who needs to find problems and manage dozens of small tasks Hi all, Hopefully these kinds of questions are welcome. One of the members in my team is an engineer who builds and tests new products. It is normal for him to find dozens of problems - many of which require negotiation with designers, customers and QA folks to resolve. He tends to be stressed out by the long list of tasks because they all require stakeholder input and the timing can be out of his control. It clearly affects him some days so we talk and I try to understand what can be done to reduce the pressure. It’s not an excessive work load situation, the pressure to complete is largely self imposed. We are not an organization that blames people nor has this employee ever experienced consequences for missing an problem or timeline. He just seems to get hung up when there are lots of little follow-ups nagging at him. I’ve encouraged him to be mindful of the stress and try to reprogram himself to have a more positive outlook of each problem that comes up. After all, we view this role as somewhat of a savior organizationally... why dread the inevitable? Design bugs are part of the process. Just today he was in my office venting about how manly people he was waiting on for input and I encouraged him to make lists of open items each morning rather than carry them around for the day in him head. This is something I do as a manager to keep from feeling stressed but he was skeptical. Are there other techniques that I might suggest to help keep the pressure of lots of little tasks from overwhelming him?",1
"The reality of depression Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine. This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building. So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone. Life isn't worth the pain."" My reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there.",1
"People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies. UPDATE So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former. Original post Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves. Edit It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. Edit 2 Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means. Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there. Edit 3 If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc ",1

"School Stress I’ve lost all my motivation to learn, and even if I do find it, I can never focus. I don’t particularly enjoy learning, but I can understand that it is something I have to do to get good grades, but I’ve never had such a though time making myself study. I have some exams this April, and my parents keep on pressuring me to study, they tell me that if I get less than 90%, they’ll ground me. They’re even telling me to not do my homework and just study. I’m trying, I really am, but whenever I finish reading a bit, it’s just as if I’ve never read it. Whenever I do a practice test, I read the question, and I answer something completely off (as in the question asks me to write the smallest value, but I write the 3rd biggest and I don’t even notice my mistake). I don’t know what to do to get my motivation and concentration back. I keep imagining myself getting high grades and making my parents proud, or studying and understanding everything, but I can’t focus, and I can’t actually get myself to be that person that I’m trying to be to make parents like me, which stresses me so bad (I don’t want them to ignore me for days because of a grade, I also don’t want to be grounded and get accused of not studying even though I did).",1

But recently I met someone who is actually the most perfect person I had ever met, its like God deadass crafted her for me.

I can't go back to that hopeless void I used to live in. I had a once in a lifetime chance and I fucked it up I suppose. This heartbreak is killing me. And I know this is the depression subreddit not the relationship problems boohoo subreddit, but I swear its appropriate. I can just feel the soulless greyness of life before her creeping back in.

"Need some advice helping a friend with BPD and more. Hey. I am using a throwaway account as I feel that's the only way I can talk safely about this. I am a 28 year old male from Europe. English is not my first language, so sorry if some of the sentences don't make perfect sense. I have a female friend for 6 years. She is in her early 20s, very attractive and very smart person. She is the only person that I have considered a real friend for an extremely long time and very important to me. We have spoken multiple times about dating, but we feel like we love eachother but just met at the wrong time multiple times. Because there were multiple times. Initially I got to meet this girl 6 years ago as she was boyfriend of a mutual friend of ours. We were drinking out and she drank way too much. Her boyfriend didn't care too much for her so I took care of her and she later said that's her best memory of me. I made her feel safe. We talked a lot, however we got into an argument when they broke up. We ended up not talking for 2 years. We are both great on ghosting sadly. We ended up talking again 2 years later after I messaged her. We became friends again quickly and talked a lot, mostly online though as I moved away from the city she lives in. I admitted that I loved her and she said she cares for me a lot, however she is together with someone. She sadly ghosted me again because she felt like couldn't talk to me with her having a boyfriend. We ended up talking again 1 year ago in November. I once again became friends with her real quick, but this time it was different. She was about to break up with the boyfriend she ghosted me for. She needed a lot of support going through this and I helped her all the way. She also ghosted her best friend that she grew up with so I essentially became her best friend. We hanged out a lot. I told her that I would be moving back to the city once I finished university in summer. We talked once again about dating and she said she needs time which I totally understood. In January we talked a lot about meeting up, which was extremely though as covid was peaking really hard at the time. Sadly in febuary we part ways. I feel like it was my fault this time that she wanted to leave me. I always knew she was mentally not all right and I'm sure I have some mental issues as well (multiple males in my family are bipolar, I have been depressed every since my last romantic relationship. At first I didn't even want to love her because I Just felt scared that I would suffer but I couldn't stop loving her). Since then I researched a lot about BDP and I feel like if I done that sooner I would have recognized all the red flags and didn't drive her away. She forgave me in march and said we could try again however sadly we ended up not talking until this weekend. We were both baiting eachother to message eachother through various ways, but it was beyond obvious both of us wanted to talk one and other. I don't think I was ready what was about to come. She messaged me on friday very drunk. She said she loved my new hair, but she also said that she shouldn't have messaged me because this will cause only pain for both of us. She said she is doing has been doing horrible. She was on a holiday into a neighboring country and she got drugged and raped one night. I felt shocked. She was already feeling terrible before, she way always somewhat suicidal, attempted it multiple times when we weren't talking. She said she is planning to do it again soon. I offered to help multiple times but she said she didn't want to mix her online groups with her irl friends anymore as it caused her too much pain already. She said she only messaged me because she missed the attention I gave her, but she would have never done it if she was sober. I tried to message her next day but sadly she wasn't willing to share anything anymore she rejected any of my help and stopped answering the next day. I don't know how I can help this person. I started reading case studies about her situation the same I read about BDP. She said she is beyond saving but I know she is a strong person that just had a lot unfortunate events in her life. She really doesn't deserve any of this. I want to check up on her in a few weeks but I am afraid that I would just make her block me or push her further away. Her birthday is also coming up that I got awesome gifts for, but I feel like that is a bit scary topic aswell. In June (before her vacation) I got her a beautiful prepared butterfly in a wooden shell. It's really a beautiful piece of art and I know she was obsessed by butterflies however I am scared it would remind her what happened to her. She suggested me a book back in winter called The butterfly garden by Dot Hutchinson. The story in one sentence basically is about a serial-kidnapper and killer family that kidnaps 16 year old girls tattoos butterflies on their back, rape them and live with them until they are 21 and then they are killed and prepared like butterflies in glass shells. I'm scared that this gift would only make her feel worse but I have some other amazing gifts lined up. The issue is im unsure of her address (I'm unsure about housenumber) and I'm sure she wouldnt feel safe me either going to her house delievering it to either. I'm also just have no idea how to approach her now, how much time should I give before trying to contact her. I know I would wait forever for her and support her all the way but I Just feel lost now. Sorry for huge WOT and I'm sure half of the sentences make no sense, but some help would be greatly appreciated.",1

"Subconscious anxiety manifesting physically - need help Recently I found myself having a sensation of tightness in my chest and throat (globus sensation). It’s been around for about 2 weeks now (no, it’s not COVID) and it’s super uncomfortable. The only relief I get is sleep. I don’t have as many anxious thoughts like I used to but I am under a lot of stress with work. There is nothing I actively dislike about my job; it’s just that there’s a lot to do at the moment and it probably won’t let up for another few weeks. I’d happily work through it except I can’t go one minute without feeling like I need to inhale very deeply because of this horrible sensation in my throat and chest. I was on 10 mg of citalopram until recently (which helped me out of a really bad patch) and I’ve upped to 20 mg on the advice of my GP. Waiting for it to kick in. I have also been taking 100 mg of L-theanine twice a day in the morning and at night. I take 600mg of KSM-66 Ashwaganda at night too. I also have tried diazepam on occasion (I‘m wary of its addictive properties so I don’t take it regularly and am not comfortable with taking more than 4mg in a day) but this sensation is not going away. Beta blockers make me incredibly tired - I’ll happily try it on a weekend but for work days it’s not going to be great. Does anyone know any way that I can get some relief from this? I don’t exactly know what I’m anxious about so I can’t actually change my thought patterns. The work stress is probably one of the causes but there’s nothing I can do about it at this moment and I just wish that it didn’t manifest itself in this horrible physical way. Backstory - I definitely have issues with anxiety and have done for pretty much my whole life. Had a really bad period between April and June but through counselling and changing my medication, my thought patterns have definitely got on better. I also changed jobs which has been a massive help.",1
"I feel like I've nowhere to turn What do you do when you've complained to your friends and family so much about stress over the years that no one even takes you seriously anymore? I'm in a bad place where I e got a lot of seriously important life events to get on with and no energy left to do them. Everyone I'm close to is breathing down my neck about getting stuff done when I can barely get out of bed. If I try to explain what's wrong I'm greeted with rolled eyes or being told to grow up. Suicide has never been an option for me but now with the addition of some serious medical problems that I haven't even sorted out yet I'm in so much mental and physical pain 24/7 that I don't feel like I've got the energy to try anymore. I really just want help but it's impossible to get professional help right now, and everyone I love is sick of hearing about my problems or doesn't have the slightest idea of how to help me. I deleted this post a few times not sure if I should bother but I'm at the end of my rope here. I can't seem to convey how in trouble I am to anyone close to me so I feel like there's no way to improve my situation. On top of that I'm supposed to be moving 800 miles away by December 1st when I haven't even started packing yet and I'm totally broke. I'm essentially completely screwed right now and I havent the slightest idea of how to fix this, like I said I can barely get out of bed.

It seems like there is no support whatsoever or people think I'm too stubborn to get anywhere with me. Even doing drugs has no effect. I spent a good decade doing drugs to help manage my stress but they have no effect anymore.

I know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little, but this is different.

"Help with job burnout I think I’m experiencing job burnout out. I am a clerk at a major national grocery chain, for 19 years now, and since the corona virus scare really hit my state 3 weeks ago we have been working at break neck pace non stop. The work load is enormous day after day with no end in sight. I have not been working any overtime only 40 hours a week but this pace has finally gotten to me, I am physically and mentally exhausted.

I'm in a brain fog even as I write this so I don't have the right words but thank you for all your stories, support, advice, information and so much more. As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful. Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition. A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room."" Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease. So I hope you have had ""a-ha"" moments about your condition too. So that we can all be on the way to recovery, like some have fortunately accomplished. ",1

"I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm not a big reddit poster but what I have to say.. I'd like at least a select people to hear it. Idk if I can help anybody but if it helps you to know people are going through the same thing, I'll tell you I'm going through it. I'm a 26 yo male, and used to be the happiest man, without a problem in the world. It all started when I was about 16/17 years old. I had chronic pain and severe kidney problems. I went to multiple doctors searching for a cure or a procedure that would return me to normal. None of the doctors I visited seemed very interested in fixing my issue as they did in just prescribing me narcotics. I was pretty straight laced and at first wasn't even interested at all in taking these medications. I just wanted my problems fixed. However, the doctors insisted and quite literally talked me into taking these medications that controlled me with script after script coming for the better part or 4 years. Here I sit now, after 8 surgeries and probably close to 100 prescriptions for oxycodone, Vicodin, Dilaudid, and yes, even fentanyl. Wishing I would have just dealt with the pain and never given in to taking the narcotics even once. Addiction is such a real thing and it can happen to anyone. I hate to say I'm not at fault for this because I'm sure some of the blame is on me. But this cycle of addiction, depression, and suicidal thoughts and actions would likely not be there if it wasn't for me being given script after script and forcefed pills since I was a teenager. Now I buy drugs from the streets just to feel anything and I just wish more than anything that one day I can put this neverending cycle behind me. I'm sorry for the rant guys and thank you to anyone that takes the time to read this. For reference, this was in the US during probably 2012-2017 when so many doctors were getting in trouble with the law for over prescribing opioid medications. We hear all over the news about what happens to these doctors and pharmacists... But what about the likely hundreds of thousands of lives that were impacted by them getting patients hooked on pain killers, forcing them to either go through constant depression, pain, and withdrawal symptoms (which sometimes feel worse than death itself), or going out and finding these drugs elsewhere and buying them for their own use. This is what led to such a major opiate epidemic in the states, and why so many have lost their lives to this painful and seemingly impossible to escape cycle. Again, sorry for the rant. I love you guys red_heart ",1

"Need Guidance Long story short. I had a very stressful event in the beginning of Dec. 2 weeks passed and my body starting acting up around Christmas time. It felt like I had a stomach flu or something. I was sick for nearly a week with nauseous and fatigue. After I got better, I had a normal week afterwards. Then all of a sudden, I get nauseous out of no where and my heart starts beating fast. Idk if thats a panic attack or not. But those are the only symptoms that would occur. Once that happen, the next following days I'll stay nauseous or stomach feeling full. Wouldn't eat right. So this has been a cycle. Now fast forward to present day. It has slightly gotten better. But now everyday I wake up feeling really nauseous when I brush my teeth and poop. And have little appetite. I want to eat, but my body won't let me eat alot in the morning. I take a 4 mile walk later on the day and the remainder of day is closer to normal. Idk if this is cause of stressed body? Or the stress caused a GI issue. I have no idea whats going on. I have lost 10 pounds in 2 months and I'm already a skinny dude. Has anyone gone through this? Or have an idea what it might be? Anything helps. Thanks ))",1
"I need some stress help So I've never posted on reddit or go much to anyone for this kind of stuff. I'm a young female marine, I tend to take care of myself, but recently I've got some things that just kinda..gnaw at me. Here's my stressors. -I am on on crutches currently due to multiple stress fractures in my foot. -My mother has some severe medical problems, her favorite dog is dying right now. She's very emotional and lives with my dad, who's a criminal at heart, he's a felon and gets in jail about twice a year. He's also very emotionally abusive -Im dealing with a very difficult MOS school, the atrittion rate is about half of the class fails every time. I won't be specific, but chemical warfare is hard. I may get recycled due to injury. -Ever since I got on crutches, the platoon avoids me like a plague. I can't ever call or ask anyone for help. Marines are tight knit, we're like a family, but I don't think I could depend on any of these people. Just this weekend not a single person would lend me a laptop to finish a course online so I wouldn't get dropped, but on my phone I could see all those same people on steam when they told me they were busy doing it too. I've gotten a lot of nasty comments about my crutches, people tend to use it to put me down. -im worries about my physical fitness if I'm gonna be out of commission so long. We have PFTs, CFTs and weight requirements to adhere to. I try to do upper body, and some other excercises, but doc tells me to take it easy, I feel like I can't.

"My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2 Hi everyone, I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast. I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves.

"I feel like I have no friends There’s a long backstory to part of my feelings around this topic, but the basics are that I have a twin and we’ve always shared everything, including friends; nearing the end of high school they got really annoyed with this and told me all our friends weren’t mine because they were friends with them first so I essentially cut off a good five or ten people. Then I had my one friend who was mine and only mine. She got a boyfriend near the end of high school as well though. We were still close, but I rarely saw her. Then they broke up two years ago, and we’ve been super close for the past two years. Until recently. She got a new boyfriend and I hardly see her or talk to her anymore. My sister who I’ve always been close with has a long term boyfriend too, and I’m considered the third wheel to their relationship so I don’t hang out with them much either. One of my friends from high school who I cut off recently got back in touch with me and we’ve been getting close again. But about a month ago she got a new boyfriend and I haven’t talked to her since. Another of my friends just moved a 20 hour drive away for school. Another one just moved to a new continent for a study abroad program for a year. I thought my mental health was getting better.

I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay. It feels like I am living a double life that I cannot escape.",1
7 Billion Lives. What's 1 More? I am on the edge of committing suicide and I have a few hours remaining to decide whether I end my life.,1
I think I just messed everything up I had a Depression strike and went here to make me fell better that am not alone. When I got better by writing some comments on other posts I started to give advice what should other people that I thought are in same situation as me should do and how do I feel about it. But now I think i did a mistake of posting bad advice.,1
"I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die. I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer.  Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. ",1
"I wanna help my gf but cant My girlfriend has depression. We are together since 11 months. In the first 6 months everything was beautifull, she told me before, that she already had depression, but I didnt saw any signs. Its was hust a dream relationsship, with no fights or anything. So in the last months with some intervalls between, which are getting shorter evertime, she lays in bed until 4pm, insults me sometimes. I can do what I want, be as romantic as I can, but she doesnt realy care. She misses her appointments, and often she talks bad about things I do or my friends. Says she has no time for me and goes out with friends. She is already in therapy, but it doesnt help. Her mother and I tried to convince her to go in a psychical hospital. She already has been there, and developed a real anxiety for it. In her good phases, she says that she want help, but then she refuses any help. I dont now what to do... i realy love her, would do anything for her. But the only solution I see, is to leave her, I cant help and sometimes I make things worse. Slowly I get my own problems with that. To love someone who cant (currently) love back is very exhausting. Can you guys give me some tipps? Or tell me how I can stay better through this? Thanks )",1
"I never post anything in my family chat group because my rich and succesful brother overshares his accomplishments to an extreme amount, and now I'm the bad person My brother is in his 30s, and he's rich and succesful exactly in the way society likes you to be. Healthy, good looking, long term partner, big house, and constantly overachieving at his job, always getting promoted, always looked for new challenges. I have never seen him fail at something. He has never been fired, never had trouble making friends, never been bullied, never had trouble finding relationships. I'm in my twenties. I have autism and ADHD, and my life is a mess. I've never held a job longer than 6 months. I lived with roommates during college, but the pressure became to much and I had to move back home. I have a small group of friends I'm actually very happy with, but I had huge social issues in the past and I'm still definitely impaired in that area. I'm fighting HARD to get my shit together. Now, we have a shared family group chat, and literally 90% of it is my brothers sharing his accomplishments. It's a never ending stream of vacation pictures, fancy work lunches, promotions, parties, etc at least once a day, often more. He'll be on vacation and post 20 pictures a day of what he's doing and how amazing everything is. And of course my parents drool over it. At some point I just started tuning out and don't even read it anymore. They say Instagram is bad for your self esteem, but this is a million times worse. I seriously cannot take another smiling vacation selfie anymore without wanting to punch a wall or hurt myself. I truly want to be happy for their accomplishments and success, but it just eats away at me. And people comment on it too; ""you never share anything"" ""you're not involved with the family"". I've talked about it before and basically got a response like, ""well you could at least be happy for others"". Yes, I try. It gets harder when the sharing never ever stops. They make me feel like I'm a bad person, while all I'm trying to do is preserve the last of my sanity and feeling of self worth before I go over the edge completely.",1
"Positive relief ideas with stress? Hi all, my mom has been working from home since the beginning of the pandemic. On top of her incredibly stressful job, she is taking care of my grandma who has Alzheimer’s, cooks homemade dinner every night, pays all of the bills, and more on top of running around to help others with the little time she has left. She has had 0 time to herself, she feels terrible on the inside, she is stressed out beyond belief, and she cannot sleep which makes things worse. Any ideas for what I can do to alleviate some of her stress? I want to give her something to look forward to, to help her sleep better and to get through the days. Any ideas? She has been unable to workout because she had surgery recently and hasn’t been cleared to workout and we are in lockdown.",1
"Breakdown I really think I lost my mind last night, I’d had such a great day and was in bed and I literally had this mental episode. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever experienced. I felt like I was dying and I couldn’t hear or see anything beyond myself. I thought I was doing better pensive_face this feels like such a blow.",1
I feel as if I actually died a long time ago and I am on autopilot now I feel like I died a long time ago and I just run life on autopilot at this point. I am a shell of the person I use to be. Almost like a zombie. I don't know if it's years of isolation or depression rotting my brain.,1
"Is it wierd that i have imaginary friends at the age of 16 (almost 17) ... i feel like the ultimate loser 16f ... cant manage to make friends and get overwhelmed with online friends (. Well i have this teddybear which is a lil bit taller than me and i pretend that he is my imaginary friend (called thao btw... i dunno why) so i watch YouTube videos with him, talk to him when i'm sad/suicidal and so on . Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else. I havent even told this my close online friends nor my psychiartists because i'm so scared that they will laugh at me. I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head. Besides thao i take videogame charaters as my friends i really really like and kinda adore lol... am i the only one ?",1
Head and Eye Pressure Since October (for the last 4 months) I have had the following symptoms 24/7 - I wake up with them and go to sleep with them and nothing changes how they feel. Constant head pressure back top of the head. Constant pressure behind the eyes. Constant brain fog. Constant blurred vision and sometimes lightheadedness. Inside my head feels like it’s vibrating and It feels I’m going over waves visually. Overall I have a feeling that I am not fully present. I feel tired and just in a fog. Doctors really have had no clue what this is. I recently started a medication for stress and anxiety but that hasn’t changed anything in a few weeks. Any ideas?,1
